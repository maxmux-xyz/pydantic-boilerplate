00:00:09.280 didn't make it we won't say who it is
00:00:10.960 but my Lord when he comes on this show
00:00:12.759 you are going to laugh your ass off
00:00:14.280 because he's awesome I like the
00:00:15.519 comedians I think that their takes on
00:00:17.400 society and culture are pretty
00:00:18.680 interesting I think do you think it will
00:00:20.160 work in our format what's your
00:00:21.519 prediction here we've never done it I
00:00:23.119 think the quality of the show is best
00:00:24.720 when it's less just people doing takes
00:00:27.199 and it's more the back and forth banter
00:00:29.000 so yeah that's what I'm always trying to
00:00:30.279 do is get the ball to go around the horn
00:00:32.719 and get some real dialogue going here

00:01:37.159 with it love
00:01:40.799 you you want an intro to the show or get
00:01:42.960 some warm-up an about Jeopardy or do you
00:01:44.840 want to go right into Epstein the letter
00:01:46.520 from Pam to cash is is crazy dear
00:01:50.680 director Patel before you came into
00:01:53.320 office I requested the full and complete
00:01:56.439 files related to Jeffrey Epstein in
00:01:59.200 response to this request I received
00:02:01.600 approximately 200 pages of documents
00:02:04.719 late yesterday I learned from a source
00:02:07.960 that the FBI field office in New York
00:02:10.598 was in possession of thousands of pages
00:02:13.000 of documents related to the
00:02:14.519 investigation and indictment of Epstein
00:02:17.120 despite my repeated requests the FBI
00:02:19.680 never disclosed the existence of these
00:02:21.599 files when you and I spoke yesterday you
00:02:24.040 were just as surprised as I was to learn
00:02:26.480 this new
00:02:27.959 information by 8:00 a.m. tomorrow
00:02:30.519 February 28th the FBI will deliver the
00:02:34.080 full and complete Epstein files to my
00:02:37.200 office regardless of how such
00:02:39.319 information was obtained there will be
00:02:41.480 no withholding or limitations to my or
00:02:44.599 your access my question to you guys is
00:02:47.440 do you think that this is much to do
00:02:49.280 about nothing then that the FBI needs to
00:02:51.760 have the discretion to be able to say no
00:02:54.519 or do you think this is one of these
00:02:55.720 things where you're not allowed to uh do
00:03:00.560 what they're doing I think it's above my
00:03:01.920 pay grad I don't know the law of like
00:03:03.959 FBI
00:03:05.120 investigations and then what if they
00:03:06.840 investigated a bunch of people they were
00:03:09.200 not guilty and then they were in the
00:03:11.040 files maybe they need to look at them
00:03:13.799 before they do a document on maybe
00:03:15.519 there's informant in there I'm trying to
00:03:17.080 think of what happened with like The
00:03:19.720 Whistleblower papers from um this says
00:03:22.760 something different this doesn't say
00:03:24.879 let's negotiate what we should release
00:03:26.879 together so that we protect people this
00:03:29.400 says
00:03:30.400 we're just gonna lie to we're gonna lie
00:03:32.439 to you and tell you that you know here's
00:03:34.159 here's that's her side to the story
00:03:35.680 maybe they have another side maybe the
00:03:37.000 FBI has a different side we have to hear
00:03:38.480 from them right is this just like people
00:03:40.680 are intrigued by the gossip angle of it
00:03:43.000 or is it because they want to prosecute
00:03:44.560 people for hurting people or is it
00:03:47.080 because they want to cancel people and
00:03:48.760 this is a nice opportunity to cancel
00:03:51.200 like what's what's what's the I think's
00:03:53.480 happen interesting question because this
00:03:54.840 thing's been going on for 20 years I
00:03:56.400 think this actually has more to do with
00:03:57.840 conspiracy there is and now the Deep
00:03:59.360 state like is there a deep State cover
00:04:01.680 up is the question I think the question
00:04:04.360 is if the chain of command requests
00:04:07.840 something are you allowed to withhold it
00:04:10.400 because you decide in your own judgment
00:04:13.519 that the person above you doesn't
00:04:15.760 deserve to know it I think that's an
00:04:17.160 important question yeah the thing about
00:04:18.759 the FBI is the FBI can withhold
00:04:22.120 information from the president from
00:04:24.560 other folks if there's an ongoing
00:04:26.919 investigation sources are like secret
00:04:29.360 and they would be Jeopardy and National
00:04:31.759 Security concerns I'm I'm reading here
00:04:33.560 so I'm very excited to see these next
00:04:35.360 two days unfold listen it's a breaking
00:04:37.080 news story we'll have more to say about
00:04:38.800 it next week when we get the facts all
00:04:40.440 right it has been an amazing 24 hours
00:04:43.919 for my guy David freedberg I am so proud
00:04:47.440 of you if people don't know David
00:04:50.520 freeberg was on I'm sorry Celebrity
00:04:52.800 Jeopardy this week and he had a great
00:04:58.360 performance Je you can't say that I
00:05:01.560 can't say it you're right bleep it out
00:05:03.120 bleep it out so you were on celebrity
00:05:05.840 quote unquote Jeopardy shows you how
00:05:07.880 much of a bar there is the bar was
00:05:09.400 pretty low they they're now inviting
00:05:11.039 podcasters apparently but Jeopardy's
00:05:12.960 watched by like 10 million people every
00:05:14.919 episode right yeah they have like a huge
00:05:17.000 audience on regular Jeopardy I think
00:05:18.800 it's like 9 million a night or something
00:05:20.639 or seven seven to n million a night yeah
00:05:22.880 but I think Celebrity Jeopardy because
00:05:24.160 it's like later it's got a smaller
00:05:27.120 audience but it's still like couple
00:05:28.360 million people watch this thing which is
00:05:29.960 crazy so you were on and for the last
00:05:32.639 four or five months we've all had to
00:05:34.440 like bite our tongues and you've been in
00:05:37.960 a full scale I don't want to say panic
00:05:41.120 but you've been hand ringing about your
00:05:43.520 performance and spoiler alert freeberg
00:05:47.000 won not only did he win heing crushed it
00:05:51.520 I was like watching this this was like
00:05:53.479 better than watching the World Series of
00:05:55.360 Poker or a Knicks Warriors game for me
00:05:58.280 here is my my favorite M moment the
00:06:01.479 Allin call as a tribute he gets the deli
00:06:04.199 double and I'm going to go Allin Ken oh
00:06:07.880 okay how dare you 12,800 for Dave but
00:06:11.199 you have to be correct in African
00:06:13.240 geography known for its snows this
00:06:15.919 Tanzanian Peak is both Africa's highest
00:06:18.599 and the world's tallest freestanding
00:06:20.400 Mountain what is Mount kilamanjaro that
00:06:22.840 is correct
00:06:24.360 12, what did you think of that moment
00:06:26.440 Shan he goes all in and these people
00:06:28.759 they think that they're to get freedberg
00:06:31.000 by giving him a question about Africa
00:06:33.759 not knowing that he's
00:06:38.199 african-amer honestly like a
00:06:39.919 six-year-old you guys want to hear
00:06:41.360 something crazy so sixy old should know
00:06:43.440 that category no that so that category
00:06:45.280 African geography I was at dinner the
00:06:47.039 night before with our friend Xander and
00:06:48.880 his wife uhuh and we started talking
00:06:52.039 about their son was taking a quiz on
00:06:56.400 African geography and they started
00:06:58.039 giving me all the questions and we were
00:06:59.720 actually quizzing at dinner the night
00:07:01.400 before on African geography it was like
00:07:03.639 a Slum Dog Millionaire moment and I was
00:07:06.080 like in my head I'm like there's no way
00:07:07.560 that's real that that actually happened
00:07:09.280 we literally were just talking about
00:07:10.400 African geography at dinner the night
00:07:11.759 before and I'm like the judges had to
00:07:13.759 have been listening or something but but
00:07:15.680 you were nervous you talked about being
00:07:17.440 nervous and your techniques our friend
00:07:19.879 Jason [ __ ] but the we actually are lucky
00:07:23.280 enough to play with one serious
00:07:25.840 professional poker player in our game
00:07:28.280 Jason [ __ ] comes to to the game and he
00:07:30.360 coached you a bit what did he what did
00:07:31.639 he what was his advice to you well I was
00:07:33.639 a little wound up because I watched
00:07:35.319 Jeopardy my whole like since I was a kid
00:07:39.160 right I mean I don't watch it regularly
00:07:40.759 but like a couple months ago I was kind
00:07:42.280 of watching the show I kind of reached
00:07:43.639 out and was like Hey you know do you
00:07:45.919 guys know anyone on the show and that's
00:07:47.560 how I got like hooked up so and I'm like
00:07:51.400 wait I'm really going on that's awesome
00:07:53.400 okay and they're like you're going on
00:07:54.759 Celebrity Jeopardy so I watched the
00:07:56.039 Celebrity Jeopardy episodes from last
00:07:58.280 season and and I figured I could get
00:08:00.440 like 60% of the answers but you get
00:08:04.400 there and you don't realize how hard it
00:08:07.280 is to buzz in in time because if you
00:08:09.159 buzz before the light turns on I've
00:08:11.240 heard this over and over how does it
00:08:13.840 work because you bought I understand an
00:08:17.680 actual buzzer to practice with am I am I
00:08:19.840 correct you did this well yeah I bought
00:08:21.520 this cheap buzzer on Amazon the pressive
00:08:23.479 but it didn't do anything so I'm
00:08:24.680 watching the TV at home watching old EP
00:08:27.599 Celebrity Jeopardy episodes from last
00:08:29.080 year and I'm like oh buzz in buzz in but
00:08:31.039 the problem is when you're there you're
00:08:32.080 not allowed to buzz till the light comes
00:08:33.479 on and if you buzz too early you get
00:08:36.240 locked out for a quarter second and that
00:08:38.958 quarter second makes a huge difference
00:08:40.880 so I was actually behind the people I
00:08:43.519 was against most of the show I felt when
00:08:45.959 I was buzzing in I'm like I know the
00:08:47.120 answer and I kept missing I kept missing
00:08:48.920 so I still did okay obviously but wait a
00:08:51.560 second let me ask you a question about
00:08:52.640 that buzzing thing a light goes on when
00:08:55.120 does the light go on when the question
00:08:56.720 is finished or after half show the
00:09:00.000 question on a huge screen so the whole
00:09:01.600 screen gives you the question right away
00:09:03.120 when so you can read ahead so you can
00:09:04.440 read ahead just read the whole thing
00:09:05.800 boom yeah then you have to wait for Ken
00:09:07.760 Jennings to finish as soon as he
00:09:09.279 finishes enunciating the last syllable
00:09:11.680 of the last word the like turns on but
00:09:14.519 here's what I found out there is a delay
00:09:17.399 of about 150 to 200 milliseconds
00:09:20.959 difference between your eyes and your
00:09:22.800 ears you actually hear stuff before you
00:09:25.480 see stuff and which is really
00:09:27.640 interesting like for your brain to
00:09:28.839 register it and people have different
00:09:30.440 different delays but for me I'm like
00:09:32.200 waiting for the light and then I buzz in
00:09:34.360 and it's too late because the people
00:09:36.120 next to me have buzzed in so speed of
00:09:37.399 sound vers but anyway I was a little I
00:09:39.079 was a little wound up going into this I
00:09:40.320 called Jason [ __ ] because I realized
00:09:41.959 there's no upside by the time I show up
00:09:43.519 I'm like I'm gonna look like an absolute
00:09:44.880 idiot for saying some stupid stuff
00:09:47.000 getting answers wrong which of course
00:09:48.440 everyone texts me last night being like

00:10:46.399 different and I realize as I'm walking
00:10:48.079 in Jeopardy I'm like you know what
00:10:49.120 there's no upside because what'll happen
00:10:50.959 is everyone will just call you an idiot
00:10:52.320 for the things you miss which is well I
00:10:54.120 mean and let's face it you're the Sultan
00:10:57.760 of science you went to an
00:11:00.040 you worked at Google so there's an
00:11:01.440 expectation you should run these people
00:11:03.160 over you did run them over for you know
00:11:05.040 who you're facing in the semi-final we
00:11:07.600 don't know until all the quarterfinals
00:11:09.639 are over and that'll be in the next
00:11:11.959 couple weeks here when you see a
00:11:13.519 category come up like the hooers one
00:11:15.440 right I think that one was about sports

00:11:32.440 go like look I'm not a guy who gets very
00:11:35.040 nervous I don't get like stage fright or
00:11:37.680 like wound up but for Jeopardy it's so
00:11:41.120 weird you're up there and you can't
00:11:43.480 focus or concentrate like you normally
00:11:45.079 can my brain had these like weird brain
00:11:47.600 farts where I'm like I know the answer
00:11:49.120 why isn't it coming out or I buzz in and
00:11:50.920 I said like Beethoven instead of De I'm
00:11:52.720 like why did that come out God for CLA
00:11:54.720 Delon you don't have to I mean dude

00:11:58.760 weird stuff that happens up there that's
00:12:00.399 really hard to explain and then you're
00:12:01.639 angry about the buzzing you can't buzz
00:12:03.160 in in time and you're on the set of
00:12:05.120 Jeopardy and it's like oh my God I'm

00:12:24.199 practice round in front of the audience
00:12:26.040 just so you get everyone gets used to it
00:12:28.240 and I deliberately answered wrong and I
00:12:30.959 was like acting like an idiot and acting
00:12:32.399 like I couldn't buzz and acting like I
00:12:33.519 didn't know theed I tried to be like he
00:12:36.920 I tried to be a little so diabolical

00:12:47.079 you yeah I've done that before in a bar
00:12:48.600 fight once I was like guys guys we don't
00:12:50.079 need to get in a fight and then like
00:12:51.360 bang I just clocked the G anyway we're
00:12:53.399 so proud of you you won you trounced
00:12:56.000 them I have to say the for the Humane
00:12:58.519 Society United States all the money went
00:13:00.120 to charity Humane s of the US how much
00:13:01.760 did you make for them in the end if you
00:13:03.240 win the whole tournament it's a million
00:13:05.000 dollars and thenot of do food as the
00:13:07.880 winner your charity gets more and the
00:13:09.600 losers their charity gets less but it's
00:13:11.040 a fixed amount it's like 30,000 or
00:13:12.519 50,000 or something like that nice I
00:13:14.760 think they should put the three of us on
00:13:16.240 together normal episode that would be
00:13:19.320 crazy oh my God I would wreck three of
00:13:21.760 us were on I would wreck your ass no you
00:13:23.519 would not I will play you heads up
00:13:25.720 Jeopardy anytime for money let's play I
00:13:28.639 say we play poker we'll play for all of
00:13:30.880 the Allin
00:13:33.680 profits I'll give you two retards twox
00:13:36.720 the chip stack and let's see what
00:13:37.880 happens oh my God and that sounds so
00:13:40.320 compelling would you do it actually J
00:13:42.279 would you do that would you do it all
00:13:44.240 the profits all the profits I do it for
00:13:46.680 all the profits but I would carve out
00:13:48.320 25% of the profits for a four-way
00:13:50.240 tournament that was televised live if we
00:13:51.959 could get 2 million in sponsors then
00:13:53.240 we'd be up no matter
00:13:54.720 what grift endless not grifting I'm
00:13:58.000 thinking like a business the whole point
00:13:59.720 is no I want to do this so that I
00:14:01.800 inflict pain on one of you or both what
00:14:03.839 gives Chim happiness is hurting others
00:14:06.040 that's we that's his love language his
00:14:08.800 love language hurting the people he
00:14:11.519 loves love language is hurting the
00:14:13.680 people who love him I like putting you
00:14:16.600 two to the test and I like to see you
00:14:18.079 two break okay this what makes him feel
00:14:20.160 good anyways did you guys see Brett
00:14:21.880 atc's tweet no what did you say friend
00:14:23.839 of the Pod Brett atock who's a CEO and
00:14:26.199 founder of figure he just announced
00:14:28.279 today that he's moved his timelines up
00:14:31.040 by two years he's going to Beta Testing
00:14:34.199 robots in the home by by the middle to
00:14:36.440 end of this
00:14:37.440 year that's crazy
00:14:39.839 crazy crazy I mean are you an investor
00:14:42.600 in his company I don't talk about my
00:14:45.000 investments but in this casos here but
00:14:47.839 in this case no I'm not an
00:14:50.160 investor so we're not talking a book
00:14:52.360 here I do think Optimus and this figure
00:14:55.600 and the other this about a dozen of
00:14:57.639 these doing it credibly if they can make
00:15:00.160 these for what shamama 20 grand when do
00:15:01.959 you think it becomes something a middle
00:15:03.399 class household you know dual income
00:15:05.320 household would buy one of
00:15:08.000 these five years from now 10 years from
00:15:10.440 now how how could they be well I think
00:15:13.160 the issue is bounded by two things one
00:15:15.639 is
00:15:16.839 that I'm not sure that the generalized
00:15:19.279 AI is good enough yet and what he did
00:15:22.839 was he had a deal with open AI which he
00:15:26.199 pretty publicly cancelled a few weeks
00:15:28.000 ago m and he announced his own model and
00:15:33.480 I don't know the details of it to know
00:15:35.279 whether he rolled it himself or this is
00:15:38.000 just like taking some open source based
00:15:40.959 model and iterating from
00:15:42.959 it but I think the model is not perfect
00:15:46.319 yet to be general purpose that's one and
00:15:50.079 then the second is a practical issue
00:15:51.519 with the robots which is that the
00:15:53.399 actuators themselves are good but
00:15:56.160 they're not great and you can see it in
00:15:58.079 in the demo where it's an incredible
00:16:01.040 demo because it shows the value and the
00:16:03.040 power of the model where there's sort of
00:16:05.199 this Master Slave orientation that has
00:16:07.440 to happen where one model is actually
00:16:09.000 doing most of the computation and the
00:16:11.240 second model and the second robot is in
00:16:13.120 feeding off of it and the demo that they
00:16:15.519 do Nick you can probably find the video
00:16:17.279 is of them sorting a bag of groceries
00:16:19.959 for the first time totally unsupervised
00:16:22.440 which and it's it's an incredibly cool
00:16:24.199 demo it's a cool demo the thing that
00:16:26.480 that you notice though is that the
00:16:27.759 actuators are good they're not great and
00:16:29.399 so the physical dexterity is still
00:16:31.199 relatively limited and I think that that
00:16:33.600 doesn't allow these robots to be super
00:16:35.480 functional in the next couple of years
00:16:37.079 but when they get that figured out then
00:16:39.519 I think it could be really useful
00:16:40.800 because if you have a robot like this
00:16:42.399 that could sort the groceries make food
00:16:46.680 do the laundry mow the lawn so to speak
00:16:49.759 it just requires a level of dexterity
00:16:51.560 that's not yet totally possible but see
00:16:53.839 in this example what you're seeing are
00:16:55.240 the two robots basically figuring out
00:16:57.480 how to communicate semantically between
00:16:59.240 the robots and that's incredibly
00:17:00.800 powerful and it's yet another sort of
00:17:03.040 breakthrough that we need so I don't
00:17:04.359 know we're probably like a couple years
00:17:05.880 away but see look at the dexterity there
00:17:08.079 he's taking the pepp farms and feels
00:17:10.599 like he's crushing the pepp Farms or she
00:17:12.559 or whatever you call this robot they
00:17:14.119 then please don't misgender the robot
00:17:16.400 but it's it's really incredible they're
00:17:17.919 figuring the the coolest part of this
00:17:19.640 demo by the way which I loved was they
00:17:21.760 take an apple and then the second robot
00:17:24.839 figures out that it should go in the
00:17:26.640 fruit bow pushes the fruit bow to the
00:17:29.480 first robot and then the first robot
00:17:32.080 that's cool there it is but that level
00:17:34.280 of semantic awareness and understanding
00:17:36.400 between two models working
00:17:39.400 dependently is very cool look at that
00:17:42.559 that's very cool they're collaborating
00:17:44.600 with each other makes total sense I can
00:17:45.840 tell you here on the ranch I would love
00:17:47.960 to have an allpurpose robot going out
00:17:50.160 there and using the weed whacker and and
00:17:52.280 trimming the the the the bushes and the
00:17:54.799 hedges and getting me wood and
00:17:56.320 collecting chicken eggs like there's a
00:17:58.000 million things they could do on a ranch
00:17:59.840 it be immediately applicable for ranch
00:18:02.760 work and if they're 24 hours a day it
00:18:04.640 doesn't matter if they go slow but I I
00:18:06.520 think this is the category people are
00:18:08.000 sleeping on and I I don't know who on
00:18:10.039 the on our prediction show said this
00:18:12.320 will be the year of robots but it's been
00:18:14.039 this is the year of robots for 30 years
00:18:15.679 in the industry and it does feel like
00:18:17.240 this is it freeberg you're sticking with
00:18:19.559 your prediction I assume yeah I am yeah
00:18:23.159 I think it's
00:18:24.960 also it's not just this kind of
00:18:27.200 dexterous automation but but I do think
00:18:30.360 drones autonomous
00:18:32.840 vehicles I put them all in the same
00:18:35.120 category where there there's some it's
00:18:37.039 some combination of mechanical response
00:18:41.039 to a machine Vision
00:18:43.320 system that uh I think has become like
00:18:47.440 accelerated this year you need a lot of
00:18:49.159 rare Earths to make robots yeah where
00:18:51.280 could we ever get those from H does
00:18:53.320 anybody owe us a little money is anybody
00:18:54.840 behind on their payments maybe The Vig
00:18:56.600 could be a little you know taste
00:18:59.919 I don't know if you guys have seen this
00:19:01.080 but there was a company in the 90s that
00:19:02.760 was all the rage called segue they were
00:19:04.640 going to absolutely change cities and
00:19:06.440 everything and they never did but it was
00:19:08.280 basically like a scooter you could walk
00:19:09.679 on and had a a balancing uh kind of
00:19:12.679 system to it but they made robots and
00:19:14.280 here they're making these lawnmowers now
00:19:17.039 and these lawnmowers are really like
00:19:19.200 cheap they're a th000 bucks and they
00:19:21.000 work here in Austin I have seen two or
00:19:23.720 three of these on people's Lawns this
00:19:25.720 could be like you know what was the one
00:19:27.720 that you did in your house Roomba so
00:19:30.440 your point freeberg there will be
00:19:32.240 Purpose Driven ones to deliver you a
00:19:34.559 burrito do your lawn Etc and a room is
00:19:37.679 like three or 400 bucks I think and this
00:19:39.799 thing's a th000 bucks man this is going
00:19:42.559 to get crazy I do think it's it's a lot
00:19:44.080 harder to create one of these general
00:19:46.000 purpose systems in automation then
00:19:48.679 create like vertically or kind of
00:19:51.320 utility specific automation system so a
00:19:54.520 device that just does one thing delivers
00:19:56.480 something to you in the air or drives
00:19:58.280 your food to you or loads and unloads
00:20:01.080 your dishes you know I'm not sure if
00:20:03.360 that's the whole the whole idea of the
00:20:04.919 humanoid is it's ambitious yeah it is a
00:20:09.360 general purpose device and it makes a a
00:20:12.919 technically very hard road map I got to
00:20:14.960 imagine some of the bulldozers out there
00:20:17.159 are also now becoming remote controlled
00:20:19.679 so you can get like a a bulldozzer that
00:20:21.400 you have to put in a dangerous situation
00:20:23.600 and their remote control and they're
00:20:25.360 going to have ai so I got pitched on a
00:20:27.559 startup one time that was to go up into
00:20:29.320 Tahoe Hills and allow humans with remote
00:20:32.919 controls to drive Jam off little
00:20:34.600 bulldozers and make fire pths so imagine
00:20:36.640 some fire breaks out you send in or
00:20:38.919 helicopter in the bulldozzer no human in
00:20:41.840 it just got a 5G connection or a
00:20:43.559 starlane connection and Zip Zip Zip
00:20:46.120 you're doing fire roads in the middle of
00:20:47.799 the smoke dense area it's going to be
00:20:49.679 really interesting when these things uh
00:20:51.919 get dialed in and they're getting every
00:20:54.000 day I'm going to ask Brett to be a ba
00:20:55.960 Alpha tester of one of these robots in
00:20:57.600 my house and then we'll go and do we'll
00:20:59.159 do a segment that would be great excuse
00:21:01.480 me
00:21:02.520 robot can I get some more morels toot
00:21:05.760 sweet morels let's talk about stripe I
00:21:07.840 thought the the report was really good
00:21:10.080 we had the cison brothers on last week
00:21:12.000 they crushed it great job to them and
00:21:14.320 then um here is a quick summary so uh in
00:21:17.360 terms of processing volume Aden 1.34
00:21:21.039 trillion stripe at 1.4 trillion I mean
00:21:23.240 that's incredible that they're both in
00:21:24.840 the almost the same exact space one's
00:21:26.480 growing 33% strip going 38% valuation
00:21:30.760 Aden 56 they're public stripe private
00:21:33.440 91.5 billion I guess that's the private
00:21:35.640 Market premium employee account very
00:21:38.200 interesting here since we've been
00:21:39.320 talking about uh Jamie Diamond's uh rant
00:21:42.000 last week Aden 4.3 th000 stripe over
00:21:45.120 8,000 and uh both are profitable aden's
00:21:48.279 got a billy in iida which is
00:21:51.360 extraordinary but stripe has a higher
00:21:53.200 margin what's your take on aala Two
00:21:55.039 Cities here I thought there was three
00:21:56.679 takeaways the first takeaway for me was
00:21:59.400 the value of Stripes ecosystem is is
00:22:02.240 probably underappreciated I think
00:22:04.120 Patrick mentioned it but he just kind of
00:22:06.760 said it as a passing fact and none of us
00:22:09.200 picked up on it but in the report they
00:22:11.440 talk about all the additional products
00:22:12.919 that they're able to build around core
00:22:14.480 payments and one of them is the billing
00:22:16.120 product it's half a billion dollars a
00:22:17.799 year of ARR that's just incredible and I
00:22:21.159 think if they figure out Network effects
00:22:22.880 inside of the stripe ecosystem that's
00:22:25.039 interesting so that's first which is The
00:22:27.720 Hubb and spoke of of payments being at
00:22:29.440 the center been all of these other
00:22:30.679 incremental Services I think that that's
00:22:32.320 really interesting and underappreciated
00:22:34.240 for stripe that probably speaks to why
00:22:36.080 there's such a difference in valuation
00:22:37.919 because aen has less of that ecosystem
00:22:39.919 or at least it's not nearly as well
00:22:42.000 described maybe as Stripes is that's
00:22:43.600 number one second is I go back to what
00:22:47.000 I've been saying for a while now but the
00:22:48.559 the rise of these stable coins is really
00:22:52.039 interesting the stable coin
00:22:54.000 infrastructure globally the push for a
00:22:57.880 bunch of these National governments to
00:23:00.120 embrace them inside of India inside of
00:23:03.120 Brazil slowly it's happening inside of
00:23:05.400 the United States so I think that that
00:23:07.279 was really
00:23:08.520 interesting and then the third takeaway
00:23:11.080 Nick I sent you this tweet was just the
00:23:13.720 the nature of the
00:23:16.159 AI ecosystem relative to the rest
00:23:20.360 of SAS and what this is was from Stripes
00:23:25.039 report which showed the time to get to 5
00:23:28.520 million of annualized Revenue and the
00:23:31.520 average SAS company took 37 months and
00:23:34.640 by 2024 the top 100 AI companies got
00:23:37.880 there in 24
00:23:39.320 months I mean that's efficiency in the
00:23:42.520 market right I mean that's why we're all
00:23:44.279 looking at AI saying we could see a lot
00:23:47.000 of our economic issues come from growth
00:23:49.279 and the growth is very clear you can do
00:23:51.120 more with less and you can generate more
00:23:53.559 Revenue with AI so it's it's pretty
00:23:55.240 clear the trend yeah jaman I think it's
00:23:57.640 really clear I mean I can give you a
00:23:59.640 little factoid from 8090 you know we got
00:24:02.919 to 5 million of Revenue in three
00:24:06.000 months really crazy couple of WS in
00:24:08.919 there yeah couple of big ones yeah and
00:24:11.880 so it's just a very different selling
00:24:14.200 motion than than I've historically seen
00:24:18.840 where the ROI is just so obvious in
00:24:22.200 terms of the efficiency that it creates
00:24:24.159 and the cost savings you can generate
00:24:27.120 relative to traditional enterprise
00:24:28.880 software it's a more straightforward
00:24:30.919 sale the ROI is clearer the revenue is
00:24:34.159 bigger it happens faster yeah so there's
00:24:37.840 also I don't know if you're seeing it
00:24:39.039 but there's a sense of urgency in the
00:24:40.640 market right now people feel like they
00:24:43.640 have to adopt this new technology fast
00:24:45.640 because there's competition because the
00:24:47.799 gains are so clear because in a slowing
00:24:50.200 economy this is maybe a way to
00:24:52.080 accelerate Revenue I'll be honest with
00:24:53.799 you at least with the our 8090 customers
00:24:56.320 I haven't seen that yet you know we're
00:24:57.840 in
00:24:59.120 I don't know eight or nine segments of
00:25:01.120 the economy big segments of the
00:25:04.000 economy it's more still about the
00:25:06.640 frustration that they have with what I
00:25:08.200 would call the software industrial
00:25:09.640 complex there's a big and you you can
00:25:12.120 see it with what's happening to
00:25:13.760 Salesforce and other big companies is
00:25:15.720 that these renewal Cycles are getting
00:25:18.039 harder and harder to
00:25:19.600 justify and so people are willing to
00:25:22.720 take some bets and see if there are
00:25:24.720 different ways in dealing with this
00:25:26.200 problem and I think that's the real
00:25:28.000 opport
00:25:29.120 is if you can find a repeatable
00:25:32.880 pattern to help these companies replace
00:25:37.440 that big software spend that they have
00:25:41.000 yeah that scales really quickly and the
00:25:43.080 only way to do that really is using AI
00:25:45.320 in two ways AI inside the Machinery of
00:25:49.240 what you're using yourself to make the
00:25:51.120 things right so those are things like
00:25:53.120 cursor and whatnot to just fully
00:25:54.720 accelerate and then AI within some very
00:25:57.520 specific product that the customers
00:25:59.279 actually need that also create
00:26:01.039 efficiency so there's two different
00:26:02.600 places but the problem with using it in
00:26:04.399 both of these two different places is in
00:26:05.840 the first one you can manage the errors
00:26:09.159 it's very it's very straightforward at
00:26:10.440 the end of the day code either compiles
00:26:11.720 or it doesn't so even if you're using
00:26:14.039 something like cursor which is an
00:26:15.159 incredible product there are no errors
00:26:17.399 at the end of it because the thing
00:26:18.520 actually works or it doesn't the problem
00:26:20.399 is actually when you use these models in
00:26:22.279 actual work and if you're in a regulated
00:26:24.559 environment particularly it gets very
00:26:26.480 complicated because if you generate a
00:26:29.200 hallucination in a healthare business
00:26:31.880 and it causes a you know patient record
00:26:34.559 to be incorrect there are huge
00:26:36.880 consequences
00:26:38.120 there and that we haven't solved yet
00:26:40.880 that exists in regulated Finance it
00:26:44.000 exists when you're dealing with real
00:26:45.559 estate and construction it exists when
00:26:47.880 you're dealing with power it exists in
00:26:49.880 Aerospace right imagine if an llm helps
00:26:52.360 you design a plane better but if there's
00:26:55.520 a tolerance error and that's not well
00:26:57.440 understood that could have you know
00:26:59.640 horrific consequences Downstream so we
00:27:02.520 we're we're working with all these
00:27:03.640 people to try to figure it out it's a
00:27:05.159 very difficult technical challenge but I
00:27:07.720 just thought the stripe data was really
00:27:09.080 interesting because it validates what
00:27:10.320 we're seeing which is the the growth in
00:27:12.720 this industry is it's not like anything
00:27:14.520 I've ever seen before back to the stable
00:27:16.320 coins here's a look at tether they're
00:27:20.760 at43 billion in tethers out there who
00:27:24.960 knows what's reality there they've got a
00:27:27.200 little bit of a shaky history
00:27:29.240 and then usdc Jeremy oair is at 56
00:27:32.440 billion already and that's only been in
00:27:34.120 existence since like uh really an
00:27:36.039 Earnest like 2021 I do think strip's
00:27:39.720 main business could be for sitting here
00:27:41.279 in five years jamath could be sitting on
00:27:44.120 $300 billion and getting whatever it is
00:27:46.760 3 four 5% on some coupon right they
00:27:48.960 could be making 1020 billion in pure
00:27:52.519 profit if they uh have a stable coin out
00:27:55.039 there that gets widely adopted yeah and
00:27:57.559 and I and I think the best way for
00:27:59.200 stripe to actually do this is just to to
00:28:01.440 build it and to actually facilitate
00:28:03.960 payments between existing stripe
00:28:05.559 customers because again it's sort of
00:28:07.559 what I said last week these are all
00:28:09.000 ultimately Ledger entries and I think
00:28:10.840 that the more that you can commoditize
00:28:13.399 these things to be a simple Ledger entry
00:28:15.080 inside of two systems of record at two
00:28:17.159 companies that's a much better product
00:28:19.120 feature I think stripe has the scale to
00:28:21.360 do that now and to your point they could
00:28:24.039 have an enormous stable coin business at
00:28:26.840 the same time they're probably better
00:28:29.200 off just embracing what's already been
00:28:31.880 built it may be disruptive to try to
00:28:34.200 launch yet another one I don't know they
00:28:36.640 bought that other company so I got to
00:28:38.080 think they'll launch their own but
00:28:39.679 bridge is the facilitation layer it's
00:28:41.279 the rails yeah but I mean I think you
00:28:43.440 know this is where brand comes in if you
00:28:45.080 have a trusted brand amongst developers
00:28:47.600 and uh there's three choices are they
00:28:50.320 going to take tether which people go H
00:28:53.559 maybe it's a little sorted it's offshore
00:28:55.640 I got some challenges there am I going
00:28:57.320 to use USD see okay I haven't heard of
00:28:59.279 it but okay yeah they sound interesting
00:29:00.880 oh I'm going to use stripe I'm going to
00:29:02.279 go right to stripe it's kind of like the
00:29:03.960 IBM you know or Microsoft of payments
00:29:07.640 nobody gets fired for picking shrip I
00:29:09.640 would say so not anymore not anymore
00:29:12.519 right let's go through the market update
00:29:14.519 here a lot of people are trying to
00:29:17.039 figure out are we going to have a market
00:29:20.039 collapse a boom let's just look at some
00:29:22.559 of the numbers and have a a first
00:29:24.320 principal discussion here S&P up almost
00:29:26.600 2% so far this year NASDAQ 100 flat Dow
00:29:30.399 up 3% so pretty good start to the year
00:29:32.880 in those index numbers but if you look
00:29:35.480 at the max 7 some of them have some had
00:29:37.600 some serious compression Tesla down 27%
00:29:41.200 I do think that they had a big Trump
00:29:43.360 Elon Spike Google down 10% Amazon 9
00:29:46.279 Microsoft about 8% meta Apple Nvidia
00:29:49.320 were up to varying
00:29:50.720 degrees and then coming into our taping
00:29:55.000 this week Bitcoin down 15% over last
00:29:57.200 month that too got the Trump
00:29:59.440 bump and then adding to all this
00:30:02.120 confusion unemployment is still at
00:30:04.000 historic lows we're at close to 4% and
00:30:07.480 if you look at the deportations that
00:30:09.039 were promised they've been modest to
00:30:11.159 start obviously they're just getting
00:30:12.559 started they need some money to deport
00:30:14.000 folks but they've only been deporting
00:30:15.200 500 people to a th000 a
00:30:17.200 day and we haven't heard many numbers
00:30:19.399 about the last couple of weeks as Doge
00:30:21.039 has been sort of the center of attention
00:30:24.159 so you know they'd have to get to two or
00:30:25.640 3 th000 people a day to have low
00:30:28.399 Millions let's say Cham two or three
00:30:30.000 million people deported for it to have
00:30:31.840 any impact on
00:30:33.960 unemployment finally act three and then
00:30:36.399 we'll we'll get everybody's feedback on
00:30:37.840 this CPI up 3% year-over-year we had di
00:30:41.200 down to that nice 2% handle and uh now
00:30:44.320 it's back a little bit if you remember
00:30:46.000 in September it bottomed out around 2.4%
00:30:49.039 just in time for the election
00:30:51.679 interesting how that happened that same
00:30:54.120 month the FED cut 50 bips then it cut
00:30:56.080 another 25 in December and since
00:30:58.240 inflation's been growing modestly but
00:31:00.320 steadily not insignificantly so put it
00:31:02.639 all together trth and what do you think
00:31:04.760 and then freeberg will go to you I tend
00:31:07.279 to be sort of in the Stevie Cohen Camp
00:31:09.399 it's not like the bottom is going to
00:31:10.519 fall up but there's like a lot of room
00:31:13.320 for concern I guess is the best way to
00:31:15.320 put it um Nick I don't know if you can
00:31:16.840 find that clip that at fi but he had a
00:31:20.240 very precise summary of how he saw the
00:31:23.120 world and I I I frankly just agreed with
00:31:25.480 everything that he was saying so he he
00:31:27.480 probably can say say better than I when
00:31:29.480 you take a brew of tariffs on top of
00:31:33.760 that we have slowing immigration and in
00:31:36.080 addition now you have Doge I mean that's
00:31:38.240 austerity we think growth is going to
00:31:40.200 slow to 1 and a half% from 2 and a half%
00:31:43.159 in the second half and so I'm actually
00:31:45.440 pretty negative for the first time in a
00:31:47.440 while and it may only last a year or so
00:31:50.320 but it's definitely I think the best
00:31:52.120 gains have been had and and wouldn't
00:31:54.080 surprise me to see a significant
00:31:55.639 correction I think a couple of very
00:31:58.039 specific thoughts the first is that
00:32:00.159 you're starting to see this compression
00:32:01.960 of the mag 7
00:32:04.360 towards everybody else so this is the
00:32:06.799 forward PE of these guys and so what
00:32:08.799 you're starting to see is everybody else
00:32:11.679 starting to capture back some of the
00:32:13.480 ground people are processing what the
00:32:15.519 real upside of of the mag 7 is now if
00:32:18.399 you go to the other
00:32:19.720 chart what this starts to show you
00:32:21.799 though is that MA 7 is really priced to
00:32:24.960 Perfection and so you have to believe
00:32:27.639 that the world kind of stays the way
00:32:29.720 that it is otherwise you're going to
00:32:31.559 have some amount of of mean
00:32:33.880 reversion so I think the stock market on
00:32:36.799 the margin is a little expensive and not
00:32:40.519 particularly that attractive second the
00:32:43.880 bond market has basically said okay we
00:32:45.880 are going to give you credit that doge
00:32:49.120 is going to work and that tariffs are
00:32:50.880 going to work so we've had some pretty
00:32:53.120 meaningful compression in the 10e which
00:32:55.039 I think is really interesting I think
00:32:56.639 it's very good for Bess and and for
00:32:58.399 Trump and I think I've mentioned this
00:33:00.519 before but we got to go in and you know
00:33:03.039 refinance 10 trillion in the next six
00:33:06.240 months
00:33:07.760 so you could see this thing maybe even
00:33:11.159 get under 4% if we gets a good string of
00:33:15.159 data the real problem I think though is
00:33:17.760 that if you look back and say what does
00:33:21.000 this look
00:33:22.480 like the example that I would give you
00:33:24.960 guys is in 2010 in the United Kingdom
00:33:29.279 the deficit as a percentage of GDP was
00:33:32.880 10% and the UK government embarked on a
00:33:36.559 multi-year austerity plan and they said
00:33:39.960 we're going to get the deficit as a
00:33:41.760 percentage of GDP back in line and
00:33:44.639 ultimately by 2016 it got to 3% which is
00:33:47.519 where we are trying to get to and right
00:33:49.039 now we're a little bit under 7% we're
00:33:51.760 trying to get it to 3% so it's
00:33:54.200 interesting to ask what happened and
00:33:57.159 there the bond market gave the UK
00:34:00.039 government a ton of credit so they kept
00:34:02.480 rates relatively low and they brought
00:34:05.320 them back from where they
00:34:07.000 were that seems like What's Happening
00:34:09.159 Here Yeah the stock market the stock
00:34:11.639 market kind of went sideways to a little
00:34:13.280 bit
00:34:14.639 down let's see what happens here but the
00:34:17.440 real big thing is in the UK all of this
00:34:20.839 created tremendous
00:34:22.679 dissatisfaction and you had
00:34:25.119 brexit so I think the question that I
00:34:27.399 have is is if we go through a prolonged
00:34:30.800 austerity
00:34:33.239 program and the frustration amongst the
00:34:36.000 American populace builds what's the
00:34:38.280 release valve there the release valve
00:34:40.719 was Voting to leave the EU here it's not
00:34:43.800 quite it's not obvious to me what a
00:34:45.359 release electing Trump was step one and
00:34:47.599 I don't know if there's something even
00:34:48.879 more populist than Trump other than I I
00:34:51.320 think he is the mechanism of
00:34:53.280 implementing the austerity I think
00:34:54.839 people want this austerity just the
00:34:56.399 question is what happens when the actual
00:34:58.640 byproducts of that austerity are felt by
00:35:00.440 people for six or seven years I don't
00:35:02.440 know what the answer is certainly people
00:35:05.359 are in favor of Doge and downs serving
00:35:08.920 the government more than I think anybody
00:35:11.440 anticipated people are the statistics
00:35:13.520 are showing and the polls are showing
00:35:14.760 freeberg that it's incredibly popular
00:35:17.560 when you look at
00:35:19.320 this I don't want to say conflicting but
00:35:21.800 it's a lot of
00:35:23.520 different conflicting data here as to
00:35:25.960 what's going on what do you what are you
00:35:27.720 you see in the numbers here and what
00:35:29.240 does your instinct tell you
00:35:31.280 because part of this I think is getting
00:35:33.320 used to Trump again right like he says a
00:35:35.400 lot of stuff some of them are scary some
00:35:37.880 of them
00:35:39.040 are just trolling and everything in
00:35:41.599 between so what are your thoughts here
00:35:43.400 or Market's just adjusting to the the
00:35:45.280 new uh the new team back in town the big
00:35:48.960 question in the Trump actions is around
00:35:52.720 tariffs versus the tax cuts that are
00:35:55.000 being proposed versus the the spending
00:35:56.920 cuts those are kind of of the three
00:35:58.839 levers and there's a very serious
00:36:02.040 sensitivity to the economic outlook for
00:36:04.640 growth and inflation as a function of
00:36:07.440 how far each of those three levers are
00:36:09.359 pulled and how they relate to each other
00:36:12.480 is Trump actually going to pull forward
00:36:15.160 the cuts that he has talked about or
00:36:16.960 that elon's talked about how real is
00:36:18.720 that there's a whole spectrum of
00:36:20.599 opinions on that right now on one end
00:36:23.160 you're looking at the house and the
00:36:24.520 Senate reconciliation process for the
00:36:26.480 budget proposal that they've put forth
00:36:29.200 and you're going to scratch your head
00:36:30.440 and be like are we really cutting enough
00:36:32.480 relative to what the economists and
00:36:34.040 others are telling us we need to do
00:36:35.880 meanwhile you've got Elon and Trump
00:36:37.520 saying hey we're cutting we're cutting
00:36:38.760 we're saving we're going to get to a
00:36:40.079 trillion dollars a year but that's not
00:36:41.920 showing up necessarily in the budget is
00:36:43.960 it showing up in the actions out of Doge
00:36:45.640 TBD so there's a whole spectrum of
00:36:47.319 opinions on the cuts on the Tariff side
00:36:49.720 there's a spectrum of like how far are
00:36:51.079 these tariffs going to go you know the
00:36:53.119 United States up until 18 something
00:36:58.960 was entirely tariff driven in our
00:37:01.920 federal government's revenue and it was
00:37:04.160 a way of being kind of protection to the
00:37:05.920 industry here and then over time the
00:37:08.119 tariffs rates came down and down and
00:37:09.520 down as we introduced an income tax
00:37:11.040 which started I think at 3% right after
00:37:12.880 the Civil War and went to 5% for high
00:37:14.720 income earners and then obviously in the
00:37:16.680 20th century that's totally flipped now
00:37:18.560 we have like no tariffs and a 50% income
00:37:21.319 tax for the highest bracket so can we
00:37:24.800 actually revert back to a tariff driven
00:37:27.599 an income model for the federal
00:37:29.000 government and what is the economic
00:37:30.520 effect on growth for Corporate America
00:37:33.000 in that world where taxes get cut for
00:37:35.119 the companies and for individuals but we
00:37:37.880 make all of our money from global trade
00:37:40.079 does this the The increased cost of
00:37:42.319 global trade hurt companies more than
00:37:44.680 the benefit of paying fewer taxes lower
00:37:46.599 taxes that's the big economic argument
00:37:48.920 that's underway right now and it's funny
00:37:51.079 it kind of seems to fall along political
00:37:53.040 lines believe it or not much like
00:37:55.079 everything else you know like economists
00:37:58.720 that uh that are democratic aligned are
00:38:01.079 Dem my party doing uh I agree with that
00:38:03.839 yeah yeah exactly and so the Democrat
00:38:06.359 align economists will say the tariffs
00:38:09.599 don't make sense they reduce uh economic
00:38:12.560 growth they have a negative effect we
00:38:14.280 shouldn't be doing that and then the
00:38:16.319 Republican Allied economists are saying
00:38:18.640 the tax cuts will more than make up for
00:38:21.560 the reduce the reduction from the
00:38:24.160 tariffs and that's the big unknown right
00:38:26.880 now um so I would say that the spending
00:38:29.319 cuts wide spectrum the income tax cuts
00:38:32.839 big Spectrum on what's actually going to
00:38:34.200 get done here and then the tear Up's big
00:38:36.200 Spectrum on how far this is going to go
00:38:38.280 and so those three things you've got
00:38:39.560 like three very wide ranges of things
00:38:41.720 that all interplay that ultimately
00:38:43.920 determine inflation economic growth
00:38:46.280 government deficits over the next decade
00:38:48.359 and we don't really have a clear picture
00:38:50.280 yet of how those three things interplay
00:38:52.640 and they're all being hotly debated and
00:38:54.359 by the way there's High variability
00:38:56.040 they're changing dayto day every day
00:38:58.000 Trump's like this tariff that tariff
00:38:59.599 yesterday there's a whole bunch of
00:39:00.480 confusion on tariffs today there's a
00:39:02.200 whole bunch of like discussion on how
00:39:03.880 far the tax cut extension is going to go
00:39:05.880 in the reconciliation process and on and
00:39:08.040 on and on so TBD I encourage people to
00:39:11.160 use my 72-hour Rule and look at what
00:39:14.880 happens 72 hours after Trump says
00:39:16.800 something spicy because a lot of times
00:39:18.760 he's just he says a lot of things and
00:39:21.040 not just Trump like yeah but the house
00:39:23.200 and the Senate they both put forward
00:39:25.119 their their budgets right now they go
00:39:27.720 through this reconciliation process and
00:39:30.640 there's a lot in there that leaves a lot
00:39:33.480 to be desired if you're if you're a an
00:39:37.280 absolute like you know fiscal
00:39:39.640 conservative and you're trying to get us
00:39:41.319 to 3% deficit as a percent of GDP you're
00:39:45.240 like wait a second does this do enough
00:39:47.160 and the tax cuts are 4.5 trillion over
00:39:49.280 10 years so you know it's approximately
00:39:51.079 450 billion a year if you're trying to
00:39:53.160 catch up how are we doing tax cuts but
00:39:55.640 Jal remember you can't make those
00:39:57.400 statements as fact because a lot of
00:39:59.000 those over 10year projections are
00:40:01.119 projections based on someone's estimate
00:40:03.400 of the economic effect of the tax cuts
00:40:05.760 so there's also a lot of debate on that
00:40:07.480 which is hey some people are saying if
00:40:09.319 we make these tax cuts the economy will
00:40:11.359 grow faster than this particular the CBO
00:40:15.560 economists will estimate the CBO
00:40:17.000 economists are trying to be conservative
00:40:18.560 so there's a whole lot of debate going
00:40:19.920 on right now on like how much is this
00:40:21.720 really going to cost and people like oh
00:40:23.160 my God Trump is talking about raising
00:40:24.680 our deficit so much over the next decade
00:40:26.960 but then there's a different point of
00:40:28.200 view which is wait a second if you
00:40:29.920 assume that the economy will grow
00:40:31.640 because of these Cuts then that's
00:40:33.720 actually not true and then there's all
00:40:35.200 these wild cards around the golden Visa
00:40:37.520 card yeah we're about to get to that
00:40:39.680 yeah are the tariffs going to be a
00:40:40.960 trillion a year are they going to be2
00:40:42.000 trillion dollars of Revenue or no knows
00:40:44.240 it's just a negotiating position just a
00:40:46.040 negoti so no one knows yeah no one knows
00:40:48.160 so that that's my I think main point is
00:40:51.280 this uh this Administration is all over
00:40:53.800 the place you know and the cuts are
00:40:56.200 great but's right the B market tells you
00:40:58.000 a lot the fact that the has the 10 year
00:41:00.680 was was peaked at 5% two two weeks
00:41:03.760 before the election and then it peaked
00:41:05.520 again the second week of January at
00:41:07.480 4.78% now it's down to 4.26% today so
00:41:10.760 it's come down by a full half a point in
00:41:13.480 the last month which tells you a lot
00:41:16.599 about the expectations on inflation and
00:41:19.079 growth over the next decade and it's
00:41:21.040 actually a reasonable like sign that we
00:41:23.839 don't think there's going to be rampant
00:41:25.280 inflation over the next decade based on
00:41:27.640 some of the policy decisions and actions
00:41:29.359 that are being taken by this
00:41:30.440 Administration so I would say there's
00:41:32.680 some indication that if if you were to
00:41:34.760 kind of try and decode the Enigma of the
00:41:37.520 three things that we talked about are
00:41:38.640 going on you know it's generally kind of
00:41:41.079 deflationary to some extent or it's not
00:41:42.839 inflation are you optimistic just net
00:41:44.560 net Dave you optimistic about this next
00:41:46.359 foure period or not I'm honestly pretty
00:41:48.040 uncertain and I'm pretty unhappy with
00:41:49.480 both um the Senate and the house budgets
00:41:51.680 personally I don't think fat too many
00:41:54.040 Cuts I don't think there's enough action
00:41:55.560 in there I don't think that and it's
00:41:57.359 weird because you hear Elon talking to
00:41:58.960 all the members of the the cabinet and
00:42:00.920 he's pretty clear-cut hey we've got to
00:42:02.599 save this government is in a debt spiral
00:42:04.760 we have to fix this problem Yad yada and
00:42:06.960 then it's sort of like business as usual
00:42:08.720 which like I said when we were in DC
00:42:11.079 that was exactly my observation for
00:42:12.680 every Senator representative member of
00:42:14.640 Congress that we met with or that I
00:42:15.960 talked to at a cocktail party it was the
00:42:18.040 same [ __ ] it was like I got to get
00:42:20.240 this for my people that's the goal and
00:42:22.760 we've turned this Federated Republic
00:42:24.440 into a whole bunch of elected
00:42:25.559 representatives showing up in DC
00:42:27.480 scrambling and grabbing money for their
00:42:29.400 constituents that's what they were hired
00:42:30.960 and elected to do and it's a really
00:42:33.280 unfortunate circumstance that no one
00:42:34.839 looks out for the better interest of the
00:42:36.319 US dollar over time and says you know
00:42:38.400 what we've actually got a limitation on
00:42:39.960 us and that limitation should be less
00:42:41.680 than 3% deficit to GDP that's our budget
00:42:45.359 that's our Max budget and start from
00:42:47.240 there and then do a buildup yeah yeah I
00:42:50.160 mean chamath I think Collective action
00:42:53.240 aside you've been talking a little bit
00:42:55.400 about this I don't know if it was a
00:42:57.599 couple weeks ago you were tweeting about
00:42:58.920 the great reset Theory and there's you
00:43:02.200 know whatever that is the third or
00:43:03.359 fourth turning people have been talking
00:43:04.880 about you want to uh maybe encapsulate
00:43:08.520 your thoughts I think you have to figure
00:43:10.040 out
00:43:12.200 what the goal is so one goal is you
00:43:17.880 could say that the Republicans want to
00:43:21.200 have consistent political power right
00:43:24.000 that's a reasonable goal the Democrats
00:43:25.559 want that too right a different goal
00:43:27.760 would be to do what freedberg said we're
00:43:30.480 going to go and take the lumps because
00:43:32.760 we are going to defend the dollar and
00:43:36.880 The credibility of the United States
00:43:38.760 we're just going to make sure that
00:43:40.240 structurally it's sound and take the
00:43:42.079 pain that's necessary to reset that
00:43:44.760 could be a goal I think the reality is
00:43:46.480 something in the Middle where you can't
00:43:49.359 be in one camp and you can't be in the
00:43:51.000 other because I don't think you can get
00:43:52.400 anything done and somewhere in the
00:43:54.839 middle I think the thing that I have
00:43:56.599 been thinking a lot about is when will
00:44:00.200 somebody sniff
00:44:01.640 out
00:44:03.160 what the great Coalition is that
00:44:07.359 preserves political power whether that's
00:44:09.880 the Democrats or the
00:44:11.520 Republicans the reality is that you will
00:44:14.880 have a consistent majority if you get
00:44:20.160 three cohorts of people together cohort
00:44:23.200 number one are the people that frankly
00:44:25.520 don't have many assets and are the
00:44:27.720 working in Middle Class meaning they
00:44:29.880 don't necessarily own homes they don't
00:44:31.960 necessarily have investments in the
00:44:33.359 stock market so they don't particularly
00:44:35.760 care about what's happening there okay
00:44:38.440 that cohort dominates there was a clip
00:44:41.079 of
00:44:42.800 a discussion at Harvard just this past
00:44:45.640 week about the different political
00:44:47.040 coalitions that voted for Trump versus
00:44:49.000 kamla Harris the most important takeaway
00:44:51.240 that I took from it is that if you make
00:44:53.720 $100,000 or more a year you're a
00:44:57.119 reliable Democratic voter if you went to
00:45:00.160 college you're a reliable Democratic
00:45:02.319 voter everything else is a reliable
00:45:04.640 Republican voter but the thing to
00:45:06.839 remember is that bucket of everything
00:45:08.480 else is growing faster than that first
00:45:11.160 bucket so you have this Coalition of the
00:45:14.000 asset light working in middle class and
00:45:17.680 then you have other people patriotic
00:45:19.720 business people and patriotic business
00:45:22.119 owners and Technology people that care
00:45:24.000 about Innovation that Maga has been able
00:45:26.599 to into a
00:45:29.079 coalition my point is if that is the
00:45:32.839 consistent reliable thing that cements
00:45:35.280 political power multiple elections from
00:45:37.960 now and we've seen this before in the
00:45:39.599 past where Republicans can go on a
00:45:41.000 three-term run or you know a four-term
00:45:43.480 run Democrats have as well in the past
00:45:45.680 it is bad news for the stock market and
00:45:47.760 it is bad news for asset owners because
00:45:50.040 it doesn't reward the constituents back
00:45:52.079 to Freed Brook's point so if you are
00:45:53.800 going to feed your constituents and your
00:45:55.800 constituents don't own stocks and your
00:45:58.359 constituents don't own homes or they are
00:46:01.960 so wealthy that they can be inoculated
00:46:04.400 from a massive draw down in those asset
00:46:07.720 categories what do you think the winning
00:46:09.920 strategy
00:46:11.400 is that is my rough working version of
00:46:15.760 what
00:46:17.200 our version of brexit is right so if you
00:46:20.400 have many many years of austerity what
00:46:23.040 does it really result in I think if you
00:46:25.480 want to cement political power I think
00:46:27.359 it
00:46:28.680 requires a walking down of these asset
00:46:31.400 markets in a meaningful way that's
00:46:33.800 stocks and that's real estate and I just
00:46:35.559 don't see any other way around it
00:46:37.440 fascinating the good news is I think
00:46:40.079 from my perspective is but by the way
00:46:41.720 sorry last thing I would say that's a
00:46:42.880 total Theory and I could change my mind
00:46:45.400 as I get more data but I'm just saying
00:46:46.800 like I'm just trying to work through the
00:46:48.800 possibilities and in the distribution of
00:46:50.880 outcomes that's sort of where my heads
00:46:52.119 at right now I think it's like a good
00:46:53.520 mental model because politicians want to
00:46:55.440 stay in power how do they stay power the
00:46:57.720 populace has to want to continue to back
00:47:01.359 and they have to understand what backing
00:47:02.960 strategies that that reward asset owners
00:47:05.240 when asset owners are a shrinking
00:47:06.680 minority is not a good idea well there's
00:47:09.319 60% of the country own assets but 80% of
00:47:12.280 those assets are in the top like 10% so
00:47:14.839 it is definitely weighted heavily people
00:47:16.920 do have some I guess through their 401ks
00:47:19.880 in some cases and yeah 60% of people own
00:47:22.119 a home
00:47:23.440 61% but yeah I think it's a it's a good
00:47:25.599 framework the good news is if you look
00:47:27.640 at every time we have a great
00:47:29.480 technological Revolution whether it was
00:47:31.359 the iPhone or the internet now ai that
00:47:34.880 tends to make uh the most impact on the
00:47:38.359 economy and So based on what I'm seeing
00:47:40.839 on the streets entrepreneurship is on
00:47:43.880 fire right now no but that's not true I
00:47:45.359 think you're confusing that with how
00:47:47.760 certain people like everybody has an
00:47:51.680 iPhone that's true but you're the one
00:47:53.880 that's talked a lot about this a lot it
00:47:56.359 hasn't lived lifted average hourly
00:47:57.800 earnings that much in fact we've had
00:47:59.960 massive wage
00:48:01.240 suppression it has rewarded the
00:48:03.319 employees and the stockholders of Apple
00:48:06.000 or Google or meta but that's not
00:48:09.440 everybody well I'm talking more about
00:48:11.720 yes you're correct it does polarize the
00:48:14.359 win in apple shareholders right in the
00:48:16.559 case of the iPhone or Google in the case
00:48:18.200 of the internet but it does make the
00:48:19.640 entire populace more efficient and the
00:48:22.160 United States more efficient since we
00:48:23.880 LED both of those revolutions I I don't
00:48:26.760 I think it does I think it it benefits
00:48:29.079 supremely a small cohort of people
00:48:30.880 that's why the the denominator goes up
00:48:33.800 but does it affect individual people in
00:48:36.400 measurable ways on a broad-based basis I
00:48:38.559 think that's been statistically proven
00:48:40.240 is not to be true that's why we have the
00:48:42.559 populism we have today it's
00:48:44.800 disproportionately rewarded equi holders
00:48:47.240 that's
00:48:48.319 obvious and wage earners it you know
00:48:51.240 have not had the same escalation but I'm
00:48:54.200 talking about the United States and our
00:48:56.319 place in world and our economy when
00:48:58.680 compared to other countries so I still
00:49:00.599 think if we lead AI we will still have
00:49:03.160 the best standard of living the best
00:49:05.319 overall economy in the world but I love
00:49:07.160 his what do you guys think about the
00:49:08.280 golden Visa I love that golden Vis well
00:49:10.160 this is incredible because I literally
00:49:13.200 tweeted like six months ago you know we
00:49:15.359 should just sell citizenship for
00:49:17.559 $500,000 a pop and he added a zero I'll
00:49:20.400 give you prediction I'll give you a
00:49:22.079 prediction I will predict that within
00:49:24.319 the next few months after this gets
00:49:26.240 announced
00:49:27.359 you are going to hear about Founders
00:49:30.119 taking $5 million of secondary in a
00:49:33.319 round M to make sure that if they are
00:49:36.040 non-americans to get their visas 100%
00:49:39.160 hey uh check out this prediction Nick we
00:49:41.720 now have a poly Market to trade how many
00:49:43.640 gold cards Will trump sell in 2025 poly
00:49:47.160 Market ohk well done I I think what is
00:49:51.040 the what is the bet well so you either
00:49:53.319 can have zero okay you can have one to
00:49:56.319 100
00:49:57.280 100 to a th000 here's the the different
00:50:00.240 levels 1, 2500 25 5,000 so you can
00:50:03.160 basically buy the level that you think
00:50:04.720 there's an 8% probability right now in
00:50:06.640 poly Market that by the end of 2025
00:50:09.520 there will be zero of these golden Visa
00:50:11.480 sold 25% chance of 1 to 100 177% chance
00:50:16.760 of 100 to a th000 and so on the most
00:50:19.319 probable level is actually 2500 to 5,000
00:50:22.400 which is sitting at 29% probability
00:50:24.520 right now yeah I'm taking the I'm taking
00:50:26.200 the way
00:50:27.200 so what do you think this is by the end
00:50:28.680 of 25 Jal so you got to get they
00:50:30.559 basically have to get the pr they still
00:50:32.040 have to get this done they get the
00:50:33.079 program up and running and then people
00:50:35.000 by the so it's by the end of 25 is the
00:50:37.760 okay so people are really just betting
00:50:39.280 when can he get the first one done and
00:50:41.760 then yeah H how many does he get done
00:50:44.680 yeah I know I'm going to take the top
00:50:46.880 two I think I might take 5,000 and above
00:50:48.880 here will you put real money on that you
00:50:50.200 should do that oh you can't trade it's
00:50:52.160 not available to Americans but if there
00:50:54.200 was a way to do it I might do it this is
00:50:56.319 not uned by the way called the E5 which
00:51:00.119 I talked about on this where noncitizens
00:51:02.839 can invest a of money but it's a bit of
00:51:05.559 a scam I got pitched on it people said
00:51:07.359 oh we can get you LPS for your fund
00:51:09.040 here's how it works they invest in some
00:51:11.400 you knowy fugazi real estate thing you
00:51:14.400 have to you have to create 10 full-time
00:51:16.040 jobs is the yeah so there's a bunch of
00:51:18.160 scams going on about
00:51:19.640 this5 but I said as your president I'm
00:51:21.680 going to sell these citizenships and get
00:51:23.280 100,000 people to do 500k each right and
00:51:26.200 I said would sell like Tes Swift tickets
00:51:27.960 I I got to tell you I think out of the
00:51:30.799 gate Apple meta Microsoft buy you know
00:51:36.760 one to 10,000 of these so let's say you
00:51:39.240 were able to buy these and you could
00:51:40.760 swap them out like if somebody left and
00:51:42.319 went back to their country you could
00:51:43.440 still use it you still have the Visa
00:51:45.280 these would become incredible for
00:51:46.640 recruiting Talent if you got to get the
00:51:48.119 CEO of a company over here and you can
00:51:50.200 offer them that you could buy their
00:51:51.520 company is that how it's going to work
00:51:53.119 or is that is it going to be tied to a
00:51:54.599 person do you think we got two different
00:51:55.799 issues here one is is could you swap
00:51:57.720 these between another person we don't he
00:51:59.960 the president could make it like that if
00:52:01.400 they wanted to for corporations to give
00:52:03.200 them essentially what is a a season pass
00:52:06.079 that you could swap between users those
00:52:07.720 things exist in the world as a concept
00:52:10.280 so he could decide to do that the second
00:52:13.000 piece is how valuable they are are they
00:52:15.960 worth five million or are they worth a
00:52:17.559 million which which would sell the most
00:52:20.040 the way this is proposed by Trump and
00:52:22.559 letnik is it's $5 million for basically
00:52:25.599 a green card you get permanent residents
00:52:27.799 in the United States you get to live
00:52:29.200 here permanently yeah they're getting
00:52:31.160 rid of the E5 program after this that's
00:52:33.079 their proposal and so here's here's the
00:52:35.680 MTH let me ask you guys a question Jamal
00:52:37.440 jakal how many people in the
00:52:40.799 world have a net worth above a 100
00:52:44.720 million oh above a
00:52:48.799 hundred uh well we know that there are
00:52:51.040 like 5,000 four or 5,000 billionaires is
00:52:53.799 the estimate I think globally so a
00:52:56.720 millionaire well I think that there's a
00:52:59.079 lot there's a lot of hidden billionaires
00:53:01.440 so I would Russia and China even in
00:53:03.960 America I would guess that there's at
00:53:05.760 least 10 or 15,000 billionaires in the
00:53:07.760 world 100
00:53:09.480 millionaire and so then as a s probably
00:53:12.920 50,000 that's what I said 28,000 40% of
00:53:17.240 whom are in the US which means there's
00:53:19.960 17,000 who knows that number is real
00:53:22.040 come on yeah these these numbers are all
00:53:23.359 made up so I I you know how many Russian
00:53:25.000 oligarchs have $100 million
00:53:27.200 a l okay so whatever fudge Factor you
00:53:30.599 want 17,000 is the reported number of
00:53:34.119 100 millionaires outside the US do you
00:53:35.960 think that that's the cut off for people
00:53:37.400 that would spend five million and then
00:53:38.760 what percent of them would buy a US
00:53:40.200 green card for $5 million oh I think
00:53:43.400 people with 20 million who are overseas
00:53:45.280 in Venezuela or the Middle East would
00:53:47.240 spend 5 million on it if it was a path
00:53:49.240 to them becoming a US citizen you
00:53:51.040 advertise that over a lifetime you could
00:53:52.680 make twice as much money living here so
00:53:54.160 I think the numbers like if you had $20
00:53:55.760 million you would give 25% of your
00:53:57.599 current net worth to get into the US of
00:53:59.799 course you're going to buy a house here
00:54:01.359 worth 10 million and Donald Trump said
00:54:03.319 that you would not have to pay any tax
00:54:06.440 on foreign assets right right easy peasy
00:54:10.280 it's a True Green Card yeah that is real
00:54:13.119 no no no a real green card is what I had
00:54:14.960 which is your Global income is taxed
00:54:17.839 that's true so it's worse meaning the
00:54:21.240 green card is worse than this this is
00:54:23.040 way better so if if I had to do it again
00:54:25.160 and this was available to me out I'm not
00:54:26.880 sure million bucks I'm not sure there's
00:54:29.359 a million buyers I think there's
00:54:30.960 probably 10,000 Max buyers of this thing
00:54:33.680 is my take the over of 10 I wouldn't
00:54:36.440 take the over of a million I think
00:54:37.520 you're right on the Million number is
00:54:39.480 that what did Trump say he said there's
00:54:40.599 a million Market
00:54:42.760 Nick the most probable is 1 to 2500 I
00:54:45.680 think that's probably right but you
00:54:46.760 didn't ask total you ask in year one and
00:54:49.400 I mean you it takes six months to get
00:54:51.359 anything done this poll is this poll is
00:54:53.520 dumb the real question is how hard will
00:54:56.760 they be vetted because I think the point
00:54:58.440 is there's a lot of gray money around
00:55:00.040 the world so the question is can you
00:55:02.200 bring it into the light right so how
00:55:05.359 many like look I I know of many people
00:55:08.359 in India many who are extremely wealthy
00:55:12.880 in ways that we don't understand and
00:55:15.520 their wealth is literally like in cash
00:55:17.440 it's in Gold how are they supposed to
00:55:20.119 kind of like if they wanted to like
00:55:21.920 raise their family in America because
00:55:24.640 now it's possible how do they do that
00:55:26.559 how do they how do they take their
00:55:28.680 assets do you go to JP Morgan and all of
00:55:31.319 a sudden like you show them this golden
00:55:33.440 visa and they say great we're gonna if
00:55:35.160 there's a workaround to like the kyc AML
00:55:38.520 laws honesty freeberg you could sell two
00:55:40.960 million of these
00:55:42.839 things don't think so if you literally
00:55:45.480 have to go through the
00:55:47.359 existing set of Frameworks on like ofac
00:55:51.960 AML kyc all that stuff it's probably in
00:55:55.640 the tens of all I have to say is this is
00:55:58.640 one of the greatest proposals ever and
00:56:01.720 oh it's great it's fan freaking tastic
00:56:04.359 combined with Doge okay uh if he gets
00:56:08.280 this done if he gets do but I agree with
00:56:11.480 you by the way accredited investing done
00:56:14.000 if he gets those three things done I'm
00:56:15.480 voting for his third term we're going to
00:56:16.920 redo the uh Jason just explain to us
00:56:19.039 your your personal interest in
00:56:20.599 accredited investing what's the grift
00:56:22.280 connection I'm not sure I'm fully
00:56:23.599 tracking it's not a grift connection I
00:56:25.039 feel like there's a bunch of people
00:56:26.960 stealing money doing crypto scams and
00:56:30.559 that all of that would be solved If
00:56:33.119 people could just
00:56:34.920 take a test to become an accredited
00:56:37.640 investor which is like currently six or
00:56:39.079 s% of the country and then they would
00:56:41.400 understand diversification and you know
00:56:43.599 how different devices work convertible
00:56:45.359 debt whatever and if they did understand
00:56:48.079 that you could take people who are
00:56:50.319 gambling in the stock market and allow
00:56:52.400 them to invest in private Market
00:56:55.359 companies and I believe that would
00:56:57.000 create more this issue we brought up in
00:56:59.400 the last segment about poor people not
00:57:02.000 being able to become rich people and
00:57:03.680 upward Mobility upward Mobility could be
00:57:06.280 very easily hold on let me finish my
00:57:08.240 upward Mobility could be so much better
00:57:11.039 if a person who's in Uber driver or an
00:57:13.200 HR person working you know at a company
00:57:16.119 could put $500 $1,000 instead of betting
00:57:19.760 on the Nicks or the Jets God forbid they
00:57:22.039 could put that $500 into this new
00:57:23.799 product or service they're using
00:57:24.960 LinkedIn or this new product service
00:57:26.720 they're using and then that would allow
00:57:28.680 more startups to get created there are
00:57:30.799 so many people who contact me after
00:57:32.280 reading my book and say I want to invest
00:57:33.960 in startups they can't and I think they
00:57:36.880 would be so much better off putting a
00:57:38.400 $100 or $500 into a startup than just
00:57:41.200 wasting it at roulette great I'll take
00:57:43.039 the opposite okay goad and I'll tell you
00:57:45.280 why I think you're right it would be
00:57:47.640 great but they should buy the S&P they
00:57:49.640 should buy the SNP index proven scaled
00:57:53.079 audited profitable well vetted solid
00:57:56.920 fiduciary responsibility with public
00:57:58.839 board companies yep if you learn from
00:58:02.400 the the problem is most of these people
00:58:04.680 most people even smart VCS even
00:58:06.760 intelligent people make extraordinary
00:58:09.400 mistakes in the startups that they back
00:58:11.640 I don't think that we have a shortage of
00:58:13.119 startups I think we have a shortage of
00:58:15.000 good startups and I think but if you if
00:58:18.039 you flood the market with capital you're
00:58:20.240 going to see the same problem we've had
00:58:21.640 with every Venture Capital cycle or
00:58:23.839 every private cycle which is you get a
00:58:25.760 whole bunch of [ __ ] that gets funded
00:58:28.280 that shouldn't get funded that ends up
00:58:30.079 eating a lot of people's money and
00:58:31.799 unfortunately when people are less
00:58:33.559 sophisticated and they enter the private
00:58:35.200 investment markets they're not going to
00:58:37.200 necessarily be left well off they're
00:58:39.119 going to end up getting scammed in a
00:58:40.720 different way someone's going to show
00:58:41.960 some crazy fancy PowerPoint to them take
00:58:44.599 their money and they're gon to get eaten
00:58:45.799 up which won't happen if they buy the
00:58:47.480 S&P go ahead okay yeah so let me counter
00:58:49.799 all that they should buy the S&P sure
00:58:53.480 and they can do that today right they
00:58:54.720 can get a Robin Hood account 11% a year
00:58:57.920 perfect and that's the protectionist
00:59:00.200 paternalistic approach that we've had
00:59:02.799 what that doesn't do is it makes them
00:59:04.319 nice and safe and then their $1,000
00:59:06.559 becomes 1,70 next year and $150 the next
00:59:10.359 year great they learned one lesson the
00:59:12.640 rule of 72 in compounding interest
00:59:14.480 that's the only lesson they learn but
00:59:17.160 when you start betting on startups you
00:59:18.960 learn how entrepreneurship Works how
00:59:21.079 product Market fit works and so sure put
00:59:23.359 80% into index fund and put 20% into
00:59:27.839 investing in private companies they
00:59:29.640 would learn more and when Uber wanted to
00:59:32.240 give Uber drivers access to buying
00:59:35.119 shares they're not allowed to and so the
00:59:37.359 rich can buy whatever they want they can
00:59:40.119 make whatever bets they want they can be
00:59:41.960 a private Equity they can be in all
00:59:43.599 these things that have the chance to
00:59:45.160 100x to 10x but poor people can't all
00:59:48.160 I'm saying is if they're educated and
00:59:49.880 they take a course let them do take a
00:59:53.440 little bit of risk in an intelligent
00:59:55.280 fashion and let them learn about
00:59:56.559 entrepreneurship I grew up blue collar
00:59:59.160 and I didn't have exposure to how
01:00:01.559 private for company formation worked I
01:00:03.640 didn't understand any of this I had to
01:00:05.720 battle my way to learn all of it if you
01:00:08.240 had a course and people could go just as
01:00:10.240 easily as they go to prize picks which I
01:00:12.359 bet on every Knicks game and they could
01:00:14.319 go just as easily to prize picks as they
01:00:16.200 could go to coinbase as they could go to
01:00:19.000 a private Market company invest that
01:00:21.280 would be better for Upward Mobility so
01:00:24.440 you're right people are going to lose
01:00:25.799 money but they're going to learn what do
01:00:27.799 you think Jam settle the difference
01:00:28.960 between the two of us I think that both
01:00:30.559 are true I think that we're all much
01:00:33.480 better off just owning indices or at
01:00:36.280 least that was true I think the the
01:00:38.680 problem with these indices right now is
01:00:40.319 those are not really well balanced
01:00:42.319 indices because the rules have changed
01:00:44.200 and the rules have changed because these
01:00:46.119 companies have been smart enough to
01:00:48.559 Lobby folks like S&P and S&P has allowed
01:00:51.000 these thresholds to creep up and so now
01:00:54.760 when you're buying the S&P 5 00 you're
01:00:56.359 not doing that anymore you're buying the
01:00:58.640 S&P 7 and then the rest in the 493 is
01:01:03.240 you know 60% so if that's what you want
01:01:05.720 that's fine so we'd have to fix the ETF
01:01:09.039 Market to make sure that there was a
01:01:10.280 little bit more transparency and there
01:01:11.760 was more
01:01:13.920 balance but these weighted indices are
01:01:16.160 basically just the mag s that that's
01:01:18.000 neither good nor bad I'm just saying
01:01:19.280 that's what it is and so yeah and I'm
01:01:20.880 just saying it just creates the same
01:01:22.400 problem people think they're buying
01:01:23.520 diversification because you're like hey
01:01:24.960 go here and it's diversifi ands out not
01:01:27.240 not not even diversification just like
01:01:29.200 vetted like mature real companies versus
01:01:31.839 what I think will happen which we've
01:01:33.240 seen time and again with people that are
01:01:35.359 not sophisticated or experienced when
01:01:37.119 they first enter a new a new market any
01:01:39.119 Market is this process of adverse
01:01:41.280 selection which is you have predatory
01:01:43.640 practices predatory pitches that show up
01:01:46.039 and say invest in this it's a great deal
01:01:47.680 this is the new thing most people aren't
01:01:49.720 able to vet that thing and they end up
01:01:51.960 getting taken advantage of and that's
01:01:53.559 the problem they're getting taken
01:01:55.279 advantage of it every crypto thing right
01:01:57.079 now so all I'm arguing for is more
01:01:59.680 education and a path for those people
01:02:01.640 who want to do it to show 5 hours of
01:02:04.079 Education 50 questions that they have an
01:02:07.160 above average you know knowledge of how
01:02:09.720 private companies work just so they have
01:02:11.240 the choice to do that I think the
01:02:12.839 balance that PE we will have to strike
01:02:14.760 is there are a lot of people that are on
01:02:16.359 the outside looking in with no assets
01:02:19.319 and then second there are a lot of young
01:02:21.079 people who want the high alpha
01:02:23.760 opportunities yes like crypto represent
01:02:26.880 and so free it's easy for you to pull
01:02:29.480 the ladder up from under you because
01:02:31.160 you're already rich but for people that
01:02:33.720 are not rich and if you went back to
01:02:35.799 when you were poor the question is how
01:02:38.520 would you have reacted if somebody above
01:02:40.680 you basically said I'm going to tell you
01:02:42.760 what you can invest in and would you
01:02:45.240 have said okay that seems reasonable I
01:02:46.960 know you're looking out for me I that's
01:02:49.279 question don't disagree with that I
01:02:50.520 think there's a reason we have
01:02:51.599 Securities regulations and securities
01:02:53.319 laws that public companies have to
01:02:55.200 follow but private compan are more LAX
01:02:56.960 on that's that's where there's this
01:02:58.720 distinction so I don't disagree that's
01:03:00.319 not that's not what I'm saying I'm
01:03:01.480 saying when now that you're rich you
01:03:04.200 want rules for everybody else what I'm
01:03:05.599 saying true don't don't don't
01:03:07.240 mischaracterize me chamad that's not
01:03:08.760 true at all I'm obviously a free market
01:03:10.680 guy I don't give a [ __ ] poor people
01:03:13.319 invest in I'm not I'm pointing out the
01:03:15.039 consequence of what would happen I'm not
01:03:16.760 saying I disagree with the notion
01:03:19.960 to telling you what I think is gonna
01:03:21.960 happen Okay what I'm asking you is go
01:03:23.880 back to when you were poor how would you
01:03:26.720 react I would want to invest in
01:03:28.839 everything I'm not disagreeing with the
01:03:30.640 notion I'm pointing out what will happen
01:03:32.799 which is predatory ass will show up and
01:03:34.839 they'll rip people off that's what
01:03:36.079 happens in everyone of and if you're
01:03:37.599 educated that's why the education
01:03:39.319 component hits here you'll learn
01:03:40.760 something just like people are learning
01:03:42.520 right now to not bet on the jets ever
01:03:44.279 what do you think the solution is people
01:03:46.960 can lose their ass they just need to
01:03:48.200 know they're going to lose their ass I'm
01:03:49.480 just telling you that's what's going to
01:03:50.480 happen and then you know what's going to
01:03:51.440 happen next Elizabeth Warren's going to
01:03:53.279 get on TV and be like hey we got to fix
01:03:54.839 this put a bunch of no cares what poah
01:03:57.319 has to say that's how this goes I'm
01:03:58.960 pointing out this is what happens
01:04:00.920 markets yeah I agree with you that is
01:04:02.520 the cycle but what I'm saying is how do
01:04:04.319 we fix it then how do you allow people
01:04:06.279 that don't have assets to have assets
01:04:08.920 that work for them how do we how do we
01:04:10.720 do even as as you guys know we looked at
01:04:12.760 the data even the best Venture Capital
01:04:15.079 firms in Silicon Valley with the
01:04:16.599 smartest most sophisticated people
01:04:18.319 investing in private assets were not
01:04:20.200 able to beat the NASDAQ over years get
01:04:22.520 that's true what I'm saying is what you
01:04:24.119 were saying before this is I'm confused
01:04:25.920 what you were saying before is people
01:04:27.039 should only be allowed to invest in the
01:04:28.720 I didn't say that that is what you said
01:04:30.680 that's not what ICT what you said that
01:04:32.000 is what you said that is exactly what
01:04:33.480 you said I said here's what's going to
01:04:34.760 happen I said here's the consequence
01:04:36.359 predicting Doom got it yeah here's the
01:04:38.400 other possibility of what happens eBay
01:04:41.240 Etsy
01:04:43.000 Airbnb door Dash say to the people who
01:04:46.319 are part of their networks for every
01:04:48.920 hundred rides you do we're going to give
01:04:51.000 you $100 in shares for every hundred
01:04:53.880 night you book we're going to give you
01:04:55.119 ,000
01:04:56.200 in shares of Airbnb and by the way you
01:04:58.640 can buy extra shares if you want to and
01:05:01.200 the government says you can spend up to
01:05:02.640 20% of your yearly income average for
01:05:06.000 the past few years on investing in
01:05:07.599 startups and then some number of people
01:05:10.680 who built those networks whether it was
01:05:13.839 Google's Network or eBay's Network or
01:05:16.319 Ubers or door dashes or were part of
01:05:18.279 Tesla some number of those people are
01:05:20.359 going to hit massive home runs and
01:05:21.880 they're going to move from the bottom
01:05:23.119 third to the middle third and then
01:05:25.760 number of those people are going to say
01:05:26.520 you know what I got really educated I
01:05:27.880 looked and I understood Tesla and I
01:05:30.039 understood Uber so now I'm going to bet
01:05:32.319 on this AI self-driving company and I'm
01:05:34.400 going to bet on this other company that
01:05:35.760 makes robots and delivers you know vetos
01:05:39.039 and the entire group of people in our
01:05:40.760 United States is going to get more Savvy
01:05:42.520 about entrepreneurship and capital
01:05:44.000 allocation that's a good thing I think
01:05:46.079 what's going to happen is not much of
01:05:47.520 anything I think the rules are going to
01:05:48.960 stay exactly where they are in favor of
01:05:51.200 the top 10% because I think this
01:05:52.720 argument between the two of you is
01:05:54.279 exactly the reason why it can never
01:05:56.680 change and I think that that now again
01:05:59.319 so then what is the alternative maybe it
01:06:00.960 comes back to what I said before which
01:06:02.240 is then the only alternative left is
01:06:04.319 just to debase assets and then if you
01:06:06.559 debase assets and make them much cheaper
01:06:08.839 then there's less money theoretically to
01:06:10.480 lose per Quantum of investment so maybe
01:06:13.200 that's that's the right way to think
01:06:14.279 about it we got to get more people
01:06:15.720 owning equities in this country that's
01:06:17.799 just high order bit because if you feel
01:06:19.880 like you have more agency in your life
01:06:22.240 and you're just smarter and savier
01:06:24.559 that's the American dream and we've lost
01:06:26.279 the American dream to your point in the
01:06:27.720 earli segment month half the country
01:06:29.599 doesn't feel like they can ever get into
01:06:31.400 the top half they don't feel like
01:06:33.079 they'll ever be able to buy a second
01:06:34.520 home or even a first so you have this
01:06:36.559 helplessness of one group of people who
01:06:38.119 are like I need a handout and the other
01:06:39.799 group of people are like got any stock
01:06:41.960 tips where are you making money what can
01:06:44.200 I place a bet on we're sitting here at a
01:06:46.119 rigged game we all get to play in one
01:06:48.559 casino and then everybody else gets to
01:06:50.279 work in the casino I just want the
01:06:51.839 people work in the casino to be able to
01:06:53.880 place some bets and maybe become owners
01:06:55.799 in
01:06:56.960 businesses hey you know I I think
01:06:59.000 talking about the US Postal Service is
01:07:01.839 interesting it turns out Trump is going
01:07:04.599 to issue an executive order to dissolve
01:07:06.960 the leadership of USPS and the postal
01:07:10.240 service is going postal about this in
01:07:12.119 some ways uh not literally but they're
01:07:14.200 angry about it and they want to observe
01:07:17.079 the absorb the agency into the executive
01:07:19.559 branch uh just so you know post office
01:07:22.319 has been operating for 250 years Trump
01:07:25.520 plans to fire the governing board and
01:07:27.079 place the agency under the control of
01:07:28.880 Commerce lutnick Commerce and for
01:07:32.039 contacts US Postal Services lost $10
01:07:35.240 billion last year on 80 billion in
01:07:38.079 Revenue they can't figure out how to
01:07:39.520 just make a simple profit margin or even
01:07:41.640 break even and IT employs
01:07:44.400 635,000 workers by the way Howard did an
01:07:47.200 interview with Fox News yesterday where
01:07:49.119 he said one of the ideas that he went
01:07:52.319 back to the president with was for the
01:07:54.559 postal service to the census which would
01:07:57.440 save 4 billion a year give him another
01:08:00.359 idea which is I think that non-farm
01:08:02.599 payrolls and
01:08:04.039 GDP that data should be collected by
01:08:06.680 USPS as well because they touch every
01:08:09.039 business you can actually get instead of
01:08:11.799 sampling with all this error and all of
01:08:14.599 this craziness that we have there has to
01:08:16.759 be a way for then all of these feet on
01:08:18.520 the street to get us much more accurate
01:08:20.880 information so that the markets can
01:08:22.479 actually function properly I am
01:08:24.880 surprised
01:08:26.439 that we don't see even more dramatic
01:08:29.759 revisions and that probably again is
01:08:31.839 like errors on top of
01:08:33.520 Errors I really don't trust like you
01:08:35.600 know you showed the GDP data or you
01:08:37.000 showed the unemployment rate Jason no we
01:08:38.439 all know this stuff is crazy it's wrong
01:08:40.520 I just don't know how wrong it is yeah
01:08:42.439 and this is where Stripes data might
01:08:43.880 come in handy uh I I did a tweet about
01:08:46.279 this and it's one of the most popular
01:08:48.040 tweets or controversial I got three and
01:08:49.359 a half million views here without an
01:08:50.759 Elon retweet or anything I had a very
01:08:53.279 simple concept here Postal Service goes
01:08:55.279 down down to one time a week easy peasy
01:08:57.640 once a week there's nothing coming in
01:08:59.198 the PO US Postal Service that's that
01:09:01.080 important two all citizens starting next
01:09:04.040 year have to opt into getting postal
01:09:05.839 mail by paying $1 a year so you got to
01:09:07.960 sign up for it you got to give them a
01:09:09.158 credit card or something I'm
01:09:11.799 thinking 80% of people don't even bother
01:09:14.679 because it's all flyers and garbage
01:09:16.198 anyway and what people don't know
01:09:17.719 because I was in the magazine business
01:09:19.520 and I knew all about this we had a
01:09:21.040 magazine rate a media rate and all these
01:09:23.640 marketers have they subsidized so this
01:09:26.520 is the ultimate marketing and Publishing
01:09:29.040 grift magazines newspapers anybody uh
01:09:33.040 Publications advertisers catalogs they
01:09:35.198 pay nothing and I think they should just
01:09:37.080 double or triple the rate or remove any
01:09:39.359 discounts uh and then take all those
01:09:41.439 buildings chth put them into the new
01:09:43.600 Sovereign wealth fund redeploy the
01:09:45.319 buildings get some money out of that
01:09:47.479 give every postal work or two-year sance
01:09:49.679 or you know whatever graduate it down
01:09:52.359 full full year Severance half year
01:09:54.198 Severance quarter year severance you
01:09:55.600 retrain them and uh just let the private
01:09:57.840 markets handle this what do you think
01:09:58.880 jamtha my suggestions there was a tweet
01:10:00.679 from this woman who got leak some data
01:10:02.679 uhhuh from one of her friends or
01:10:05.480 colleagues in the government where they
01:10:06.840 broke down I think seven or eight leases
01:10:09.159 and real estate things that were
01:10:10.880 happening inside of I think it was
01:10:12.640 Veterans Affairs
01:10:13.960 maybe the numbers are just astounding
01:10:17.480 yeah half the office bace is not being
01:10:19.719 used the other half is being
01:10:20.960 underutilized it's Bonkers Bonkers
01:10:23.600 they're going to be able to sell 75
01:10:25.440 percent of the stuff so anyway you know
01:10:28.320 don't blame me here but I think it's
01:10:29.600 like a really good opportunity our guy
01:10:31.320 Jeff Bezos come on the Pod Jeff sit in
01:10:33.159 the uh sax chair one time that'd be fun
01:10:35.280 to have him on he's making some big
01:10:37.640 changes at the Washington Post he's lost
01:10:40.040 a fortune running this thing and um it
01:10:43.000 seems like he's getting engaged and in
01:10:45.320 founder mode dare I say he uh posted to
01:10:48.440 his X account and he emailed everybody
01:10:51.080 that the editorial page is going to be
01:10:52.920 run differently he said
01:10:55.840 uh that while newspapers once had a
01:10:57.719 mandate to publish opinions from the
01:10:59.199 broadest possible Spectrum the internet
01:11:00.960 now mostly covers that he said I'm
01:11:03.040 confident that free markets and personal
01:11:04.840 Liberties are right for America I also
01:11:06.800 believe these viewpoints are underserved
01:11:08.920 in the current market of ideas and news
01:11:10.679 opinion so he's going to focus on those
01:11:12.480 two pillars personal Liberties and free
01:11:15.600 markets this seems awesome and I could
01:11:18.159 get into why it's brilliant on a
01:11:20.600 publication basis but I'm just wondering
01:11:23.040 what your thoughts are with him getting
01:11:24.840 more engaged with the publication that
01:11:26.480 he was incredibly hands off with I was a
01:11:28.480 little surprised that he wrote this I I
01:11:30.480 I think that if you want to write about
01:11:32.800 personal
01:11:33.880 Liberty one of the tenants of personal
01:11:36.080 Liberty is Free Speech but he's
01:11:37.840 effectively said that
01:11:40.280 certain opinions aren't allowed anymore
01:11:43.199 I don't think that that's the solution
01:11:44.600 to the Washington Post so I all I think
01:11:47.600 it does is it polarizes the readership
01:11:49.880 even more I looked yeah inside of Google
01:11:52.040 Trends the overwhelming majority of wapo
01:11:54.679 readers are in obviously Washington DC
01:11:57.400 and then Maryland and Virginia Which are
01:11:58.880 the two surrounding states so I think
01:12:00.639 it's very much a Beltway paper I think
01:12:02.520 he's trying to have a direct influence
01:12:04.320 on the ideas that folks inside the
01:12:06.000 Beltway read and so in as much as he's
01:12:08.800 the owner he's allowed to do it but I
01:12:11.840 wasn't a fan of that idea because I
01:12:13.960 think I think the Elon plan is much
01:12:15.960 better here's a fire hose go at it you
01:12:18.600 have to find the
01:12:20.199 people despite all the conspiracy
01:12:22.280 theories I don't think he suppresses
01:12:24.040 free speech in the least in fact I think
01:12:25.560 it's a literal free-for-all inside of X
01:12:27.600 it is a free-for-all I we got Nazi
01:12:29.360 Diamond pendants coming from Kanye the
01:12:32.280 difficulty in X which I think will be
01:12:34.080 the next set of features that he'll have
01:12:35.960 to figure out is how the curation
01:12:38.199 happens yeah where you're curating I'm
01:12:42.440 curating other people are curating how
01:12:44.360 can then for example like when I go to
01:12:46.239 an account that I like there's no easy
01:12:48.560 way where I can Mass follow a bunch of
01:12:50.520 their the people that they follow as an
01:12:52.480 example right I can't just copy it I
01:12:54.800 can't sort of start with a profile those
01:12:56.760 are all these things that allow you to
01:12:58.360 just take on all kinds of opinions right
01:13:01.000 away and filter from there I think that
01:13:04.000 that is a really useful
01:13:06.600 feature so I don't know I I didn't think
01:13:08.920 that if I was the owner of Washington
01:13:10.400 Post I would have been even more extreme
01:13:12.840 on the Free Speech part I would not have
01:13:14.880 sanctioned speech so it's an interesting
01:13:18.040 point you know newspapers historically
01:13:19.840 always had a point of view they picked
01:13:21.199 as side Fox obviously MSNBC now and
01:13:23.679 cable news picked aside
01:13:25.679 this will make the publication I think
01:13:27.560 by picking a side and saying hey here's
01:13:29.120 what we stand for this is our belief
01:13:30.719 system I think it'll just make it viable
01:13:32.520 in one way and you're right he wants to
01:13:34.199 have a certain influence that's why
01:13:36.080 people buy these things that's why
01:13:37.320 they've historically owned them and uh
01:13:39.760 they have a point of view and the idea
01:13:41.719 that it didn't have a point of view
01:13:42.960 previously was probably a mirage that
01:13:46.120 some people felt there was like some OB
01:13:48.120 objectivity but I I like it I like him
01:13:50.199 being more engaged in it and uh
01:13:52.120 tightening it up all right four the
01:13:54.360 sultant of science
01:13:56.520 cha our sick friend the comedian get

00:02:19.800 both was it public prior to this week
00:02:22.800 Antonio that you were doing this role
00:02:24.800 did you announce it anywhere was I
00:02:26.519 didn't announce it were no that the New
00:02:27.599 York Times had read a story about um me

00:02:40.800 enough I'm sure they had no agenda
00:02:42.760 Antonio how does it how does it work so
00:02:44.599 when you
00:02:46.080 volunteered do is it that you and Elon
00:02:48.560 and Steve just kind of figure out let's
00:02:50.879 put a senior person at every part of the
00:02:53.879 administration where there's real
00:02:55.560 opportunity why did you end up at SSA
00:02:57.519 versus someplace else interesting
00:02:59.040 question and by the way it's great to
00:03:00.159 see you guys man thanks for having me on
00:03:01.280 I can use your last you're like you're

00:03:11.200 to return it the rental is to at the end
00:03:13.680 of the week okay um so yeah know what
00:03:16.480 happened was I had actually volunteered
00:03:18.120 to go to the VA because that's kind of
00:03:20.879 as you guys know close to my heart and
00:03:23.239 um Elon said to me look great you can do
00:03:25.440 that next but we go to essay first and
00:03:27.799 and see what's going on there because
00:03:28.879 it's you know the biggest we have and
00:03:31.280 and see what you find in fraud Wass and
00:03:32.760 abuse and so of course I said sure I'll
00:03:34.760 do that and I ended up out in Woodland
00:03:36.840 Maryland with the good people at the SSA
00:03:38.920 the soci administration and that that's
00:03:41.000 where I started that's how that's how
00:03:42.239 all this started for me and so do you
00:03:44.000 Antonio go in there with a doge engineer
00:03:46.640 as your kind of sidekick per se or you
00:03:48.959 just go there solo and you show up and
00:03:51.799 like like what happens day one when you
00:03:53.599 walk in into the place what do you do so
00:03:56.360 I brought with me um two great
00:03:58.159 professionals uh you know John and and
00:04:00.120 pton from uh from Valor um one of them
00:04:03.040 an engineer the other one I'd say a
00:04:04.280 finance ninja both these guys are ninjas
00:04:06.439 and there was already a team there
00:04:07.519 actually that was working with some
00:04:08.720 great engineers and one senior person uh
00:04:10.879 Scott cter who's from actually worked at
00:04:12.760 Lone p and start his own fund and then
00:04:14.319 had come here as a volunteer as well so
00:04:15.920 they were already doing some work
00:04:17.959 actually particularly on on the
00:04:19.040 enumeration part of the part of the
00:04:20.918 system so that the system that you have
00:04:23.240 numbers the whole cleaning up the
00:04:24.360 database the numbers they had already
00:04:25.600 started that project when I got there
00:04:28.120 and what is the mandate as given to you
00:04:31.400 you know as part of Doge fraad waste and
00:04:33.360 abuse I mean exactly what you know what
00:04:35.600 the what Bill Clinton talked about what
00:04:37.199 Barack Obama talked about what all
00:04:38.880 presidents but maybe President Biden
00:04:40.680 talked about uh going back in time it
00:04:43.120 was go figure out how to save some money
00:04:44.520 man the system is going bankrupt it's
00:04:45.720 going to be bankrupt 2037 the country
00:04:47.360 overall as you guys know and talked
00:04:49.199 about many times is on its way toward
00:04:50.759 bankruptcy want do something and go go
00:04:53.120 figure out we can save money and go find
00:04:54.520 the fraud and that's what we did you
00:04:56.520 know let's get to it you uh spoke at a
00:04:58.720 rally uh I think it was on
00:05:00.960 Sunday and you pulled up a chart here is
00:05:03.880 that chart maybe you could explain to
00:05:06.440 the American people here what this chart
00:05:09.759 shows yeah so if if I might just step
00:05:11.880 back and tell you how I got it because I
00:05:13.199 think it's important you know we map the
00:05:14.880 way we work you guys know we're very
00:05:16.199 operational Balor I've worked with all
00:05:17.639 you guys various times and what we do is
00:05:19.520 we map the entire system from beginning
00:05:21.120 to end so we we map the system from
00:05:23.080 enumeration so I get your number all the
00:05:25.240 way to the end went to the offices and
00:05:26.479 saw the office offices operate and in
00:05:28.800 that process um one of our Engineers Pon
00:05:31.919 I mentioned he found U the data so we're
00:05:34.800 looking at all the data numeration how
00:05:36.400 it works what you know what's going on
00:05:37.680 the typical stuff you'd look at and he
00:05:39.440 found this data uh called enumeration
00:05:41.400 Beyond entry right so that is the that's
00:05:44.400 and it it had this giant Ram to it you
00:05:46.880 can see their Baseline was kind of you
00:05:48.280 know 3 400,000 people all the way up 2.1
00:05:50.759 million people and that just jumped out
00:05:52.600 at us and we're like what's that and so
00:05:54.560 we dug into it and that's how this
00:05:56.919 started and so what that's showing is
00:05:58.600 social security numbers that were issued
00:06:01.880 to non-american Citizens or non-citizens
00:06:05.199 am I correct that that's the number
00:06:06.759 we're looking at so these are
00:06:08.280 noncitizens getting Security numbers and
00:06:10.199 for people who don't know just like a
00:06:12.479 little bit of background on the Social
00:06:13.759 Security
00:06:14.680 System we do this this is not abnormal
00:06:17.720 for us to give Social Security numbers
00:06:19.759 this is part of the process uh that the
00:06:22.680 government does the Social Security
00:06:24.000 number was created in 1936 for citizens
00:06:25.960 to track their earnings and in the '90s
00:06:28.919 we started giving them to non-citizens
00:06:31.479 who were authorized to work in the US so
00:06:33.960 that we could collect taxes from them
00:06:36.199 and so if you're not a citizen and
00:06:38.880 you're a green card holder which some
00:06:40.319 people in this program I think have been
00:06:42.160 you have to have a Social Security
00:06:43.360 number in order to work and you pay into
00:06:45.080 Social Security and Medicare uh just
00:06:47.240 like you as Citizens and then eventually
00:06:49.400 I think you would qualify for those over
00:06:51.599 some period of time you can also get a
00:06:53.360 Social Security number if you're a legal
00:06:56.120 immigrant into the United States on a
00:06:57.680 Visa so for example when I first came to
00:06:59.759 the United States 25 years ago on a TN
00:07:02.759 Visa I was able to get my Social
00:07:05.160 Security number because I had a valid
00:07:07.199 visa to be in the United States okay
00:07:09.759 yeah so we have social security numbers
00:07:13.599 being given to non-citizens that is not
00:07:16.400 controversial but there's something
00:07:17.639 controversial about this chart Antonio
00:07:19.240 tell us what that is so I I think you
00:07:21.960 look at the chart you'll see there's it
00:07:23.000 starts to like called 300,000 or so this
00:07:24.960 is during the covid period yeah coming
00:07:27.840 right out of it so we the 21 coming
00:07:29.639 right out of Co right so if you go back
00:07:31.000 even a couple years in 19 you'll see
00:07:33.080 that um it's about 400,000 yeah exactly
00:07:36.039 right there so um what happened was this
00:07:39.280 program was designed for so people
00:07:42.199 you're talking about you know people
00:07:43.280 that got visas this is at numeration
00:07:45.280 Beyond entries this after you're in um
00:07:47.759 there are some people in here that have
00:07:49.159 h-1bs screen cards Etc and the way we
00:07:51.759 thought about this was that's the
00:07:52.639 Baseline number that's the 3 to 400,000
00:07:54.919 a year you see and that should be
00:07:56.479 happened that's like you know there are
00:07:58.720 programs for Afghans example the
00:08:00.520 translators that came in after the war
00:08:02.080 right the people who brought it they
00:08:02.919 would be in these kinds of programs and
00:08:04.720 so the Baseline number and by the
00:08:06.240 program goes back this particular
00:08:07.479 program goes back all the way to 17 and
00:08:09.639 had legitimate use which was the kind of
00:08:11.280 people we talking about people that we
00:08:12.680 want to let in um like The CARE program
00:08:14.879 I'll make an example which are the
00:08:15.879 Afghans they would be in this number and
00:08:18.360 so what what jumped out of this wasn't
00:08:20.159 that this is here because it has
00:08:21.360 legitimate use it's that it's the growth
00:08:24.240 why did it grow this fast and what
00:08:26.240 happened that that's what we dug into
00:08:28.560 have you figured that out yet is it
00:08:29.960 because of like a covid overhang the the
00:08:32.159 one criticism I did see of the chart
00:08:33.599 that I wanted to bring up with you is
00:08:35.279 hey people want to see the 10 years 20
00:08:37.000 years before this what would we see if
00:08:38.599 we we were Look Backwards a little bit
00:08:40.479 and do you have some theories and is the
00:08:42.640 covid overhang Theory valid or is this
00:08:44.760 just Biden opened the Border as we saw
00:08:47.600 you know especially like in maybe it was
00:08:49.080 that third year of his term the 2023
00:08:51.279 year and this is the overhang of the
00:08:52.640 2023 surge what are your theories well
00:08:55.959 the answer is no categor no because the
00:08:58.519 program really started it it started in
00:09:01.079 2017 so they probably worked on it
00:09:02.640 before that right a few takes a few
00:09:03.760 years to put these things into place
00:09:05.000 they worked at it my guess is you know
00:09:06.800 back during the B Administration it
00:09:08.120 actually became active in 17 you see a
00:09:11.040 few numbers in 18 and it starts to get a
00:09:12.720 little bigger in 19 and 20 right so that
00:09:15.399 that's how we get this Baseline number
00:09:16.519 of 1920 that's where we're using that
00:09:18.040 data here um so you there isn't I can't
00:09:20.760 go back 20 years it doesn't exist and
00:09:23.519 then when we dug into it what we found
00:09:24.920 was the vast majority of the growth uh
00:09:27.320 was related to Asylum programs and PE Le
00:09:30.519 and people that came in on on ntas this
00:09:32.480 noticed to appear into the country
00:09:34.959 either at the border at the airports
00:09:36.399 mostly at the border and then we dug
00:09:38.519 further into it excuse me dug further
00:09:40.839 into it we found that there
00:09:43.120 were this is about 5.4 million people
00:09:45.480 total there were about 1.2 million
00:09:47.680 people that the status was marked as
00:09:49.279 unknown and about 1.2 million people
00:09:51.079 that were marked as general parole and
00:09:52.959 they should have markings of you know
00:09:55.079 what the program is they're under
00:09:56.200 because if you if you claim Asylum
00:09:57.880 you're supposed to claim like a real
00:09:59.399 fear I'm going to be tortured by my
00:10:00.560 country you know something's bad is
00:10:02.079 going to happen me so why I can't go
00:10:03.120 home what we find here is that a
00:10:05.560 legitimate program was in the word I use
00:10:07.959 abused it the the the requirements were
00:10:10.959 like super opened so that more people
00:10:13.640 come through and the example I'll give
00:10:15.120 you you know I have here actually the
00:10:17.680 form this the form used to be going back
00:10:19.880 in time a four-page form that the
00:10:22.240 officer have to fill out in the field
00:10:24.079 and the person that was claiming Sol had
00:10:25.480 to actually prove that they were had a
00:10:27.399 really credible fear of being you know
00:10:28.920 murdered tortured by their government
00:10:30.120 that's something B them that's that's
00:10:31.360 what SS for it turned into a form which
00:10:34.480 I can't give you but I'm going to show
00:10:35.560 you here you can if you zoom in on it it
00:10:37.120 has four questions that's it and the
00:10:39.440 four questions are super leading I'll
00:10:41.079 just read the um you know the like one
00:10:43.720 of the important ones here right so do
00:10:46.079 you have any reason for a concern about
00:10:48.160 being returned to your home country or
00:10:49.959 being removed from the United States I
00:10:51.800 mean could that be more
00:10:53.279 leading right what they did is they open
00:10:55.639 they just open the aperture on these
00:10:57.680 programs dramatically so they allowed
00:10:59.600 people that were illegal to the border
00:11:01.480 to come in Legally and as we've dug
00:11:04.000 further into it we found this took us so
00:11:06.480 you guys know me man I do like I'm a
00:11:07.920 very methodical lean business process
00:11:10.959 mapper and we went all the way to the
00:11:13.320 Border literally to Brownsville and
00:11:14.839 Laredo to ask what happened we couldn't
00:11:17.040 find the data on what these these
00:11:19.079 unknown categories were and it turns out
00:11:22.279 that when the the the folks the Border
00:11:24.040 who were great by the way um they they
00:11:25.639 really tried hard and they suffered a
00:11:27.800 lot in this this is a bit of this is a
00:11:28.920 human strategy I we talked about they
00:11:31.760 were were giving people at times notices
00:11:33.440 to appear this is the the NTA and what
00:11:36.680 that allows you to do is come in the
00:11:39.040 country and then you're you're schedule
00:11:41.399 a court date which is like six years out
00:11:43.240 so now you're in the country with some
00:11:44.720 quasi legal status you're waiting for
00:11:46.800 your court date and while you're waiting
00:11:48.079 for your court date which could be six
00:11:49.839 six years out is the average by the way
00:11:51.240 could be longer than that you're waiting
00:11:53.000 for your court date they uh you could
00:11:54.880 fill out a Sil application so without
00:11:57.480 even interview just an application by
00:11:58.839 filing a form once application's in you
00:12:01.600 can um file another form 765 to get a
00:12:05.000 work authorization once you get that you
00:12:06.880 get a 766 which is the authorization and
00:12:09.560 we automatically send you a soci card in
00:12:12.320 the mail no interview at all that that's
00:12:16.199 that's the that is the majority of the
00:12:18.320 growth you see in these numbers is there
00:12:19.639 any ID verification along the way
00:12:21.600 Antonio like do we know that there are
00:12:24.000 no duplications Happening by validating
00:12:27.000 that one individual is getting one
00:12:28.399 social security number at any point in
00:12:29.959 this process so it's a great question um
00:12:33.480 no the answer is there's no real
00:12:35.399 verification so you can you one of the
00:12:37.399 things we found we looked at this was
00:12:39.320 the the people that that some people
00:12:40.560 showed IDs some people didn't and one of
00:12:42.760 the things these would be IDs Antonio
00:12:44.639 from their home country this would be a
00:12:46.519 Venezuelan driver's license or something
00:12:48.720 yeah I mean it could be a passport a
00:12:49.880 driver's license but here's what really
00:12:52.560 sort of tipped us off and disturbed us
00:12:54.760 when we looked at the the birth cific
00:12:56.399 data that was present at the border the
00:12:58.240 number one birth date was was 1 and it
00:13:00.480 was four times more likely to be born on
00:13:02.040 1 one than any other uh day of the year
00:13:04.800 now we all know this is so they just hit
00:13:06.160 enter on that part the or they had they
00:13:08.560 could come they Al could come with
00:13:09.440 nothing we take Biometrics of people at
00:13:11.440 the border do we take like an iris scan
00:13:13.199 fingerprints and all that stuff this is
00:13:15.000 one of the issues I mean we do have
00:13:16.399 photos of of people uh we found that 23%
00:13:19.160 of the records looked at did not have
00:13:21.079 fingerprints and look the the folks at
00:13:23.519 the border were um overwhelmed and we're
00:13:26.600 not sure why this happened I will tell
00:13:28.079 you guys just to understand I went down
00:13:29.639 there both border patrol and Border
00:13:32.160 Protection told me they had the highest
00:13:33.880 suicide rates of all time during the
00:13:36.440 surge okay over 70 over 70 of these
00:13:39.519 agents committed suicide in this period
00:13:42.320 it's truly tragic because they knew it
00:13:44.199 was going on given the fact that that
00:13:46.320 all this has
00:13:48.079 happened is the Trump Administration
00:13:50.720 going to try to claim the social
00:13:53.199 security numbers back invalidate them
00:13:55.360 what would be the proper action or is it
00:13:56.680 too late are they already sort of in the
00:13:58.000 system and now you can't anything about
00:13:59.600 it so Ben it's a great question right
00:14:02.279 and the the the first question was what
00:14:04.680 are they doing I mean you know like
00:14:06.600 where are these people where are they
00:14:07.720 how are they and we've gone through a
00:14:09.639 whole process of mapping this so we
00:14:11.040 mapped it through to the benefit
00:14:12.360 programs we found uh in the benefit
00:14:14.959 programs that every benefit we looked at
00:14:16.680 was being accessed by these people you
00:14:18.279 know 1.3 million of them are on Medicaid
00:14:21.120 right now today and by the way it's just
00:14:23.079 ramping just starting just to give you a
00:14:24.959 point and then out of curiosity I woke
00:14:27.240 up at night like 2: in the morning I I
00:14:28.519 couldn't sleep mind was R on this I sent
00:14:30.399 the Andre a notes saying hey guys let's
00:14:31.519 just look at the the public voter roles
00:14:32.759 who we find in some in some friendly
00:14:34.920 States and we looked at the voter roles
00:14:36.880 and we found that thousands of them
00:14:38.040 registered to vote in a handful of
00:14:39.360 states and then we went further with
00:14:41.279 those friendly States and found that the
00:14:43.040 many of those people had actually voted
00:14:44.519 it was shocking to us and if I hadn't
00:14:45.880 seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't
00:14:46.800 believed it and so now the question
00:14:49.079 we're asking ourselves is what do we do
00:14:50.800 we've referred some to prosecution
00:14:52.240 that's ongoing right now you know we're
00:14:54.560 thinking through how to do it and the
00:14:56.880 reality is they have various kinds of
00:14:58.320 status and it's a very detailed analysis
00:15:00.800 legally they working through right now
00:15:02.199 about how to deal with it so thousands
00:15:04.320 of those people registered to vote Yes
00:15:08.360 in the election which is a federal crime
00:15:10.440 by the way well yeah I mean the
00:15:11.839 interesting thing is like the Heritage
00:15:13.320 Foundation has a very good project you
00:15:14.880 know it's obviously right leaning where
00:15:17.000 they're studying all cases of fraud I
00:15:18.600 looked at it before we're here there's
00:15:19.720 only been 24 cases since 2003 of
00:15:23.920 somebody who's a non-citizen trying to
00:15:25.560 vote now those are people caught so this
00:15:27.920 would be incredibly dramatic if it was
00:15:29.839 even a thousand people oh no Jason it's
00:15:32.240 more than a thousand I've I've seen it
00:15:34.160 um I've seen the data myself and it's
00:15:35.800 more than a thousand in just a couple of
00:15:37.160 States I mean it is shockingly bad and
00:15:39.880 this is the tip of the iceberg guys it's
00:15:41.759 the tip of the iceberg this doesn't
00:15:43.079 include the 7.8 million people that ice
00:15:45.880 has that have come in illegally and know
00:15:47.279 are here and all the people that came
00:15:48.480 illegally we don't know are here I mean
00:15:50.480 this is not a political issue I want to
00:15:51.680 be really clear about this about America
00:15:54.240 let's just take one step back because I
00:15:55.839 just want you to repeat this so because
00:15:58.639 I think it's important and we may have
00:16:00.120 just run over it a little too quickly
00:16:02.720 when you get a Social Security number
00:16:04.720 what you're saying is there's all of
00:16:07.279 these important Downstream consequences
00:16:10.519 one of the downstream consequences is
00:16:12.360 you could show up register to vote and
00:16:15.160 that's an illegitimate action that's
00:16:17.079 breaking federal law that's one but the
00:16:19.920 second is that without knowing who this
00:16:22.800 person is they can start to absorb
00:16:26.800 resources that could have otherwise gone
00:16:29.920 to an American I guess that's like a
00:16:31.680 fundamental part of
00:16:34.399 this so how do you how do you quantify
00:16:37.160 that can you just maybe explain it a
00:16:38.639 little bit more about all of the
00:16:40.560 different ways in which you think now
00:16:42.720 you know the United States ends up
00:16:45.480 leaking services to these folks and also
00:16:48.079 they could be contributing too right
00:16:49.440 they could be paying taxes into the
00:16:50.880 system and so I guess there's both of
00:16:52.880 those possibilities and both of those
00:16:54.319 have fingerprints to off so yeah good
00:16:56.440 question you know look we need to figure
00:16:58.240 this out this this is a a very it's
00:17:00.519 massively complex you can see the map I
00:17:02.360 have on the Whiteboard and our office
00:17:04.319 it's huge and we're figuring it out
00:17:06.439 right now but let me just tell you this
00:17:08.480 and every benefit program we looked at
00:17:10.119 and this is just a handful of States we
00:17:11.959 found people on all the benefit programs
00:17:13.559 and we found them on unemployment we
00:17:14.760 found them on Medicaid so adjacent to
00:17:17.079 your point the people on Medicaid
00:17:18.240 unemployment they're not contributing
00:17:20.400 they're taking out they're moing right
00:17:22.240 there are criminals I mean look we sent
00:17:24.119 this data list to the National targeting
00:17:25.880 Center they and I I don't want to get
00:17:27.559 too far into the data but I can tell you
00:17:28.679 they found hardheads in the Target
00:17:30.640 Center um of very bad people criminals
00:17:33.240 and people on ter watch list that are in
00:17:35.280 this group and so yeah I mean it's it's
00:17:37.960 a problem we got to figure out how to
00:17:38.919 deal with it and the of course there are
00:17:42.280 people that are also you know have jobs
00:17:44.280 and paying in the system that's you know
00:17:46.440 that's that's also true all these things
00:17:48.280 are true and we're trying to surf the
00:17:50.200 data and figure out how to actually deal
00:17:51.840 with it now Antonio one of the things
00:17:53.480 about the data that you triggered which
00:17:56.799 because the data is so important
00:18:00.200 frankly is a lot of people started to
00:18:03.400 try to find a way to nitpick and say
00:18:07.799 Antonio you're cherry picking or Antonio
00:18:10.000 this is not really representative and
00:18:11.880 you had some pretty big names right
00:18:14.080 people that have credibility Jim chos
00:18:16.159 probably being one of the more prolific
00:18:19.039 people a very well-known hedge fund
00:18:20.600 manager but I think you try
00:18:23.200 to articulate why their objections
00:18:27.280 didn't make any sense I think it's
00:18:28.840 important to maybe give you a few
00:18:30.799 moments here to identify what they said
00:18:35.000 and maybe debunk it so the the chart
00:18:38.360 that they're using and you can see this
00:18:39.600 I posted something on X about this it
00:18:42.120 was Apples to
00:18:43.200 oranges you can you could see here they
00:18:45.480 took a chart that included all
00:18:48.280 enumerations not the EB program the
00:18:50.799 enumeration B entry program all
00:18:52.400 enumerations they compared to our chart
00:18:54.080 they put this so just to be clear this
00:18:55.840 would have included somebody like me
00:18:57.520 coming in on a tnv or somebody on an eb1
00:19:01.400 Visa yeah the so those people being our
00:19:04.480 data too but just enumerated Beyond
00:19:05.880 entry the data on the left uh of 2020
00:19:08.960 the big bars that includes people in the
00:19:11.120 offices that includes people that got
00:19:12.720 they got uh C numbers because they went
00:19:14.559 to a consulate and like you probably did
00:19:16.600 applied ahead of time before they came
00:19:17.799 in you know those kinds of people so we
00:19:19.919 need a stacked bar chart so there's some
00:19:21.679 fun with numbers going on can you flip
00:19:23.520 back again so your number for 24 was how
00:19:26.080 much 2.1 million right yeah
00:19:30.360 yeah what they did is took they took our
00:19:32.640 data so this was you know look I don't
00:19:34.200 want to impute Negative motiv they just
00:19:36.000 maybe were confused they took our data
00:19:39.400 and they comp they added the total data
00:19:42.720 right this is just subsection this is EB
00:19:45.120 and I'm just going to use AC okay guys
00:19:47.360 this is EB only in numeration Beyond
00:19:49.600 entry which is a program as I said
00:19:51.080 started in 2017 and then it kind of
00:19:53.000 ramped up into 19 they took our data and
00:19:55.559 then they added the total Data before
00:19:57.520 that right that is apples to oranges
00:20:00.799 that's why it doesn't work and I I went
00:20:03.039 through a whole analysis of this on X
00:20:06.480 and you know the person the first person
00:20:08.080 that posted the chart actually deleted
00:20:09.559 it and sent me a post saying hey you
00:20:11.559 know I'm deleting it because I get it
00:20:12.919 you're right and apologized and ask me
00:20:15.039 some questions I don't want to get into
00:20:16.480 you know you guys know I don't post a
00:20:17.919 lot on X I don't want to get into basic
00:20:19.320 people it's not worth it the data speaks
00:20:21.080 for itself there's it basically it
00:20:22.679 basically became like a roar shock test
00:20:24.480 where people that did not want to
00:20:26.760 believe the points you were making
00:20:28.799 latched on to that chart that was shown
00:20:31.280 even though it was disproven and that
00:20:33.400 became the narrative for a good chunk of
00:20:35.039 the internet and a good chunk of for
00:20:36.679 media respons yeah I mean look you guys
00:20:38.799 know me you know me for a long time this
00:20:40.640 is not political man this is this tell
00:20:42.520 about your political background again we
00:20:43.799 haven't talked about this on the show
00:20:44.840 Antonio but I think it's worth letting
00:20:46.240 everyone hear about your background a
00:20:47.720 little bit just so folks understand
00:20:49.840 where you're coming from I was a
00:20:51.480 Democrat for 20 years I mean I I I you
00:20:53.679 know I knocked on doors for really
00:20:55.240 Clinton Iowa I was uh you know from from
00:20:58.679 Illinois and look I've got lots of good
00:21:00.679 friends are Democrats and when I explain
00:21:02.360 this sta to them they're as shocked as I
00:21:03.760 am I don't believe this I mean to say
00:21:05.440 you're a Democrat is an under you were a
00:21:07.000 Democrat is an understatement you were a
00:21:08.679 major donor and majorly involved with
00:21:10.799 the Democratic party yes Ben you you
00:21:14.120 tend to call balls and Strikes on the
00:21:15.679 program what are your thoughts
00:21:18.039 on immigration generally and how it
00:21:21.039 should work here in the US and how maybe
00:21:22.880 we can resolve this and get to and Anton
00:21:25.360 I want your answer to that question as
00:21:26.760 well maybe some reconciliation here
00:21:29.679 between the moderates Maga original you
00:21:32.840 know classic GOP Democrats and and the
00:21:35.919 woke lunatics like is there any way out
00:21:38.760 of this and and maybe perhaps what we're
00:21:40.840 seeing here with somebody like Antonio
00:21:43.039 who's a lifelong Democrat who now is you
00:21:45.520 know helping the government maybe
00:21:46.760 there's some way with data and logic we
00:21:48.919 can get through this I mean I I think
00:21:51.000 that what Antonio is doing here is is so
00:21:53.720 important specifically for that because
00:21:55.880 it seems to me there's actually been a
00:21:57.120 fairly wide consensus among the American
00:21:59.159 population for a very long time what to
00:22:00.480 do about immigration particularly the
00:22:02.120 southern border which is number one just
00:22:03.400 sto the illegal immigration at the
00:22:04.640 southern border after Biden blew that
00:22:06.559 out a lot of Democrats turned to
00:22:07.760 president Trump specifically because of
00:22:09.520 that issue and that has been the signal
00:22:11.760 success of the Trump Administration
00:22:13.000 among all the other successes the the
00:22:14.679 numbers of the Border have just
00:22:15.799 plummeted to almost zero I mean the
00:22:17.039 lowest numbers in recorded history and
00:22:18.799 that is an unmitigated success and then
00:22:20.919 I think everybody knows that we have to
00:22:22.159 sort of figure out who gets to stay and
00:22:23.279 who gets to go who's already in the
00:22:24.360 country and what Antonio is doing by
00:22:26.120 being able to discern who is here and is
00:22:28.559 net draw on the resources of the
00:22:30.159 American people versus maybe who is a
00:22:32.360 net taxpayer or who's actually
00:22:33.640 contributing who's a criminal right
00:22:36.000 there's always been this bizarre
00:22:37.000 supposition in the in the political
00:22:38.679 realm that there's no way on a onetoone
00:22:40.720 level to figure out who is who you have
00:22:42.279 to treat everybody as a class either
00:22:43.640 everybody stays everybody goes and the
00:22:45.520 reality is that even the way the Trump
00:22:47.360 Administration is doing this by first
00:22:48.600 targeting say criminal illegal aliens
00:22:50.480 for for removal and then maybe moving on
00:22:52.400 to people who are net drawn resources
00:22:54.120 who came in falsely under claims of
00:22:55.520 Asylum and now are receiving Medicaid or
00:22:57.679 disability this I've made the argument
00:23:00.360 for for I think my entire career
00:23:01.720 actually on this that that we should be
00:23:03.159 treating immigrants illegal immigrants
00:23:04.799 who are in the country the same way we
00:23:06.200 would treat people who are trying to get
00:23:07.320 into the country which is to say are you
00:23:09.559 going to benefit the United States or
00:23:10.720 are you not going to benefit the United
00:23:11.720 States and the counter argument was
00:23:12.840 always well how exactly are you going to
00:23:14.919 determine who is who and the answer I
00:23:16.919 always gave was well the IRS does it
00:23:18.240 with our tax returns literally every
00:23:20.000 single year so why should we not be able
00:23:21.880 to do that and so the kind of work
00:23:23.080 Antonio is doing showing you actually
00:23:24.320 can do that by tracking the social
00:23:26.120 security numbers of people who came in
00:23:27.960 illegally because the truth of the
00:23:30.120 number of unknown getaways is actually
00:23:32.240 really really compared to this it's it's
00:23:34.159 a small number most of the people who
00:23:36.080 are coming across the border at least
00:23:37.320 during the Biden term I went down to the
00:23:38.760 Border last year and and visited uh a
00:23:41.120 Native American reservation that's right
00:23:42.440 along the border where where the border
00:23:44.080 patrol basically was not uh and and they
00:23:46.120 said that what was happening is people
00:23:47.640 were arriving at the border they were
00:23:48.799 doing exactly what Antonio was talking
00:23:50.080 about they would literally say I fear to
00:23:51.520 go back to my home country they' be
00:23:53.120 processed they'd be led into the country
00:23:54.760 with a with a a future date to come back
00:23:57.559 and that was all happening with 72 hours
00:23:59.080 so being able to track those people and
00:24:00.360 find out who who who should be in who
00:24:03.240 shouldn't be that that's that's huge and
00:24:04.679 I think that's the
00:24:06.039 consensus so uh should we are you in the
00:24:08.840 camp we should Deport everybody this
00:24:10.520 sort of Stephen Miller Miller Deport 20
00:24:13.480 million people Ben or you and the hey
00:24:15.799 let's get rid of the criminals and you
00:24:17.600 know that will get us to where we need
00:24:19.120 to be well I don't think it's just the
00:24:20.400 criminals I mean I think you also need
00:24:21.600 to go after the folks who are are here
00:24:23.799 to take advantage of the welfare
00:24:25.240 benefits for example who are just draw
00:24:26.880 on the system um but I don't think that
00:24:28.640 the number is 20 million I don't think
00:24:30.080 president Trump actually thinks the
00:24:31.240 number is is 20 million I don't think
00:24:33.200 anybody realistically thinks the number
00:24:34.399 is 20 million got it okay but they they
00:24:36.559 said it over and over again all 20
00:24:37.919 million are going and it's right but
00:24:39.679 they say a lot of things it's AIT it's a
00:24:41.559 yes it's a political campaign and people
00:24:42.840 say that sort of stuff all the time
00:24:45.279 Antonio let's talk maybe about
00:24:47.120 reconciliation here you spent your life
00:24:49.279 as a Democrat and now you've spent I
00:24:51.360 don't know six months as a republican
00:24:53.080 here and helping this Administration how
00:24:55.240 do we get the country to sort of get
00:24:57.640 back together here and maybe reconcile
00:24:59.880 on this issue because it seems like an
00:25:02.320 unnecessary to Ben's point I I think the
00:25:04.799 number is 80% of people believe the
00:25:07.120 Border should be just shut period full
00:25:09.240 stop and everything should be legal and
00:25:10.840 I don't know the other 20 if they're
00:25:12.240 just don't know how to take a survey
00:25:14.399 I've never met anybody who said there
00:25:15.640 should be an open border at at the
00:25:17.320 southern border so what are your
00:25:18.880 thoughts on given your inside knowledge
00:25:21.720 uh and I would describe you as a Clinton
00:25:23.159 Democrat fiscally conservative socially
00:25:25.200 liberal correct me if I'm wrong there
00:25:27.440 what are your thoughts on reconciliation
00:25:29.320 here because you really do care about
00:25:31.320 that your parents both immigrants my Bes
00:25:35.000 is here three of the four people who
00:25:36.679 host this program immigrants this is an
00:25:38.760 immigrant country built by immigrants
00:25:41.120 for immigrants has always been so how do
00:25:43.679 we reconcile this issue and put it
00:25:45.200 behind
00:25:46.200 us and Jason I have asked myself this
00:25:48.520 question and I I think we got to follow
00:25:50.080 the truth and that's that's the point
00:25:52.320 follow the truth and the truth is in the
00:25:53.799 data and as as Ben said the numbers
00:25:55.960 don't lie right and so people are
00:25:57.679 productive we got find a way to to allow
00:25:59.399 them to be productive and stay people
00:26:01.080 that are are taking the system should
00:26:02.600 not be allowed to stay and you know I
00:26:04.399 think we I don't want to get into the
00:26:05.399 policy at all because it's above my pay
00:26:06.720 grade I mean the reality is for me my
00:26:08.600 remit is as as Ben said it's criminals
00:26:11.200 terrorists and then people mooching off
00:26:12.679 the system and then you know a political
00:26:14.559 question needs to be answered about what
00:26:15.679 happens to the rest of those people I I
00:26:17.320 don't I don't know I don't it's not my
00:26:19.120 remit free I I will say this yeah I
00:26:22.880 think that all my friends who are still
00:26:25.039 Democrats that I have explain this data
00:26:26.760 to they all say the same thing you guys
00:26:28.000 are saying
00:26:28.840 man this is a problem we got to figure
00:26:30.480 this out and let me tell you why the
00:26:32.399 bigger problem the biggest problem here
00:26:33.880 and it's it's definitely is taking off
00:26:35.840 the system but you got to realize we
00:26:37.880 gave 13 to 15 billion a year to human
00:26:40.960 traffickers that's what this system did
00:26:42.960 and the money magnet that attracted
00:26:44.760 these people here it wasn't like it was
00:26:46.279 some crisis that you know environmental
00:26:48.399 crisis the money magnet attracted these
00:26:50.440 people and many of them died on the way
00:26:51.840 up I mean think about what that's like
00:26:54.120 think about the this a human suffering a
00:26:56.679 human rights tragedy you have people who
00:26:59.320 are getting sold into slavery and being
00:27:01.279 abused at the border at a at a minimum
00:27:03.600 every American should be against that
00:27:05.440 everyone is every American is man this
00:27:07.000 turned my stomach when I went to the
00:27:08.120 board and I heard the stories it turned
00:27:09.840 my stomach man this we are America okay
00:27:13.120 we protect people like this we don't
00:27:15.200 give incentives to people to pay
00:27:16.760 traffickers if you pay 20,000 I heard
00:27:18.799 20,000 to 500 bucks just across the
00:27:20.880 border $20,000 I mean where do someone
00:27:23.279 who's coming from Central America or
00:27:24.679 Africa get 20 grand to pay the pay the
00:27:27.039 traffickers that are walking them across
00:27:28.760 the border it's not free to walk up
00:27:30.240 Mexico okay it's controlled by the
00:27:31.840 cartels what happens I mean they got to
00:27:33.960 pay that back how do they pay it back
00:27:35.320 they're basically DED servants this is
00:27:36.880 terrible this isn't what we do in this
00:27:38.720 country right this country is about
00:27:40.240 freedom and we are here to protect it we
00:27:42.200 protect it around the world protected
00:27:43.840 our home country and I don't think any
00:27:45.720 American that I know none of them
00:27:47.360 Democrats Republicans or anyone thinks
00:27:49.480 this is good it's not good it's bad for
00:27:51.320 America and it's evil Behavior we
00:27:53.039 shouldn't send it we shouldn't we
00:27:54.320 shouldn't give people a reason to do it
00:27:55.760 we should find legal ways people come in
00:27:57.159 the country and
00:27:59.840 do you believe that there is a
00:28:01.320 Democratic party motive to increase
00:28:03.360 voter base for the Democrats behind all
00:28:06.279 of this as has been proclaimed by some
00:28:09.679 look as I go through the data and I see
00:28:11.720 it's all about the data okay David and I
00:28:13.760 know you you you you you love the data
00:28:16.360 when you just in a handful of States man
00:28:18.440 I'm talking about four states we looked
00:28:20.320 at the voter roles we found these people
00:28:22.159 thousands of them on the voter roles and
00:28:23.679 we found uh many of those people had
00:28:25.480 voted right in one state in particular
00:28:27.360 well over a thousand voted yeah I think
00:28:29.880 this was a a move to import voters but
00:28:32.519 really importantly I just want to make
00:28:33.559 sure because when when I talk to
00:28:36.159 politicians from the Democratic party
00:28:37.720 about this they say there's aspects of
00:28:40.880 Human Rights doing the right thing for
00:28:43.320 people in need that is motivating some
00:28:46.159 of this behavior is that a lie and they
00:28:50.840 actually have a different motive or do
00:28:53.200 some in the party think that way but
00:28:55.000 there are real kind of kind of call it a
00:28:57.679 small
00:28:58.720 group of Highly influential Folks at the
00:29:01.080 top of the democratic party that
00:29:02.760 recognize that this is going to grow the
00:29:04.080 voter base and they're kind of
00:29:05.880 motivating this what do you think is the
00:29:07.440 construction of what sounds to some to
00:29:09.760 be a conspiracy and how much of this is
00:29:12.240 really like widely
00:29:14.120 understood look Ben here I'll tell you
00:29:16.360 what I have seen I've tell you the
00:29:18.159 actual information if you look at C
00:29:20.720 Administration we set all the defaults
00:29:22.559 to kind of Max open no idea requirements
00:29:25.440 right you get a soci scen number uh
00:29:27.360 before we got here by walking in office
00:29:30.840 answering you know with with with a
00:29:32.240 medical record and a school ID that had
00:29:34.720 your name and your date date of birth on
00:29:37.080 it that's it okay we opened up we set
00:29:40.240 the defaults to open on Social Security
00:29:42.480 we set the defaults to open on pay
00:29:44.919 paying people out and we set the
00:29:46.640 collection defaults basically to zero so
00:29:48.799 that's how the system looks that's I'm
00:29:50.600 just reporting reporting the facts um do
00:29:53.440 I think that the the average person is a
00:29:55.840 democrat in the in in Illinois or you
00:29:58.760 know the guys I knew I to Chicago they
00:30:00.360 know this they don't know this they
00:30:02.240 don't know this so were there people at
00:30:04.120 the top of the system did this yeah
00:30:06.039 people created this policy the former
00:30:07.720 administrators of the of these agencies
00:30:09.519 created these policies I've seen them
00:30:11.240 I've read them myself I've gone to the
00:30:13.000 data myself they've seen them now this
00:30:15.120 isn't everybody if you're the average
00:30:16.840 person out there who's a Democrat and
00:30:18.480 you see what I've seen you I believe you
00:30:22.159 will you conclude what I concluded which
00:30:23.679 is this isn't right these policies are
00:30:26.440 wrong they're evil they're wrong we gave
00:30:28.519 an incentive for people to get
00:30:29.480 trafficked that's terrible I just don't
00:30:31.559 I just don't think people know the
00:30:32.480 reason I'm even willing to do all you
00:30:34.120 guys know me I'm pretty private I'm come
00:30:35.320 to your podcast because we're buddies
00:30:36.880 but like man the reason I'm talking
00:30:38.080 about this is is not political it's
00:30:40.760 because it's a human rights issue and
00:30:42.080 the human rights issue is being confused
00:30:43.519 it's not it's we are incenting people to
00:30:46.640 pay traffickers to come to America we
00:30:48.840 were doing this right we got to find
00:30:50.519 better ways to do that and I just I
00:30:52.360 don't believe any American the 80% of
00:30:53.840 people Jason's talking about that would
00:30:55.000 say close the border that's the 80%
00:30:57.279 people come together this issue man we
00:30:59.559 got to take care of people Antonio can
00:31:01.360 you talk about what the next big push of
00:31:03.840 effort from you and your team will be is
00:31:06.399 there good question some next chart I'm
00:31:08.919 not trying to be reductive but is there
00:31:11.200 something that you can demonstrate that
00:31:12.960 is going to be equivalently as powerful
00:31:15.519 as this first
00:31:16.880 chart which then helps us start to move
00:31:20.360 these gears towards doing the logical
00:31:22.240 and right thing I think the right thing
00:31:24.360 is to figure out who's who right who are
00:31:26.600 the criminals who are the terrorists
00:31:28.760 yeah number one and number two who's
00:31:31.320 mooching off the system and then number
00:31:33.440 three the people that are working that
00:31:35.279 Jason's talking about U you know what we
00:31:37.200 do with them that's the right answer I
00:31:39.039 would add a fourth because I think
00:31:41.679 that there's probably no
00:31:44.960 more electric issue than this idea of
00:31:49.039 voting
00:31:50.159 impropriety and I think it is become so
00:31:52.559 brazenly partisan that everybody has
00:31:55.000 suspended logic if it turned out if it
00:31:58.080 turns out that there was a manipulated
00:32:00.200 effort in 2020 and there is even a
00:32:02.320 thread of legitimacy to Trump's claims
00:32:05.200 you would never be able to see the light
00:32:06.760 of day because so many Americans just
00:32:09.120 turn their turn off right and that's
00:32:11.919 because of the rhetoric that they've
00:32:13.120 been fed this is a really important
00:32:15.880 thing that I would just offer to you is
00:32:18.320 that if it is true that these people
00:32:20.799 illegally voted I think it's a
00:32:23.760 Thunderclap and I think it opens wide
00:32:26.360 the aperture on voting illegality and
00:32:29.120 voting reform and I think that
00:32:30.960 irrespective of who you are you should
00:32:34.120 want to make sure that people who are
00:32:37.039 not allowed to vote are not voting just
00:32:40.000 to put it simply yeah wow what an
00:32:42.159 incredible I mean it's amazing I can't I
00:32:44.600 I can't uh I can't get an airplane in
00:32:46.519 America without ID but I can go vote in
00:32:48.880 some states without ID I think that's
00:32:50.600 crazy I totally crazy that is and we're
00:32:53.000 down to like Ben you know the number
00:32:54.720 it's 15 states now are the ones that
00:32:57.039 don't have voter idas so this is
00:32:58.279 becoming like a very obvious issue and a
00:32:59.960 loopover for us to close I think the
00:33:01.840 best next thing for you to do is
00:33:02.960 actually publish this list of people who
00:33:04.440 voted get it to the Heritage Foundation
00:33:06.519 and put sunlight on it the truth shall
00:33:08.480 make you free and sunlight is the best
00:33:10.000 disinfectant because I think the whole
00:33:12.440 issue is
00:33:14.320 absurd because if you look at the votes
00:33:16.720 in the swing States it would take a 100
00:33:18.880 thousand it would take tens of thousands
00:33:20.600 and it's illegal I I've spoken to the
00:33:22.720 person at the Heritage Foundation who
00:33:24.120 does this they found like 2400 cases
00:33:27.799 over 40 or 50 years the number of people
00:33:31.080 voting illegally is minuscule in order
00:33:33.559 to swing even but one state you would
00:33:35.559 need coordin hold on let me finish you
00:33:38.600 would need a coordinated effort I'm just
00:33:40.519 giving you data chamama I am not partis
00:33:43.320 there are tens of thousands of vot that
00:33:45.440 would need to be manipulated in each of
00:33:46.960 these markets it's impossible here well
00:33:49.600 there's the keyw here's what I would ask
00:33:52.240 you to consider sure your results are
00:33:55.240 only as good as your prompts
00:33:58.799 your results are only as good as your
00:34:01.399 prompts say it in plain English what do
00:34:02.919 you mean I suspect that if you put three
00:34:06.559 or four of the smartest data scientists
00:34:08.800 in the world they would get to a very
00:34:11.639 different answer than the answer that
00:34:13.199 has been arrived to I don't know whether
00:34:14.639 that'll validate or invalidate the claim
00:34:17.639 yeah but the quality of the people that
00:34:19.839 are able to interrogate this data is
00:34:22.320 directly correlated to the output that
00:34:24.159 is created well listen we all want the
00:34:26.399 data clean Ben I'll maybe I'll let you
00:34:27.800 you kind of answer the question from
00:34:29.918 your perspective do you think there is
00:34:32.159 any chance that a swing state could be
00:34:35.040 swung by you know this strategy and in
00:34:38.320 addition to that Trump is a populist all
00:34:41.359 these people and his biggest gains were
00:34:43.239 with people from South America Mexicans
00:34:45.760 Etc in this last election so and
00:34:48.359 noncollege educated so if you were going
00:34:51.040 to plot this incredible strategy it
00:34:52.679 seems like the Democratic strategy of
00:34:54.159 importing a bunch of Voters is the
00:34:55.679 stupidest possible strategy because the
00:34:57.880 Republican party has won those people
00:35:00.240 well I don't think that it would be a
00:35:01.359 great short-term strategy because of the
00:35:03.400 the problems that you mentioned in terms
00:35:04.599 of the the size of the voting gaps even
00:35:06.119 in close swing States although obviously
00:35:07.560 you have outlier cases like Florida in
00:35:09.119 2000 where the entire state is being
00:35:10.680 decided by hundreds of votes and there
00:35:13.079 you actually could see a state actually
00:35:14.839 shift on that basis it's a rarity but it
00:35:17.119 does happen and and in some cases
00:35:18.560 decides a presidential election uh when
00:35:20.520 when you're talking however about the
00:35:22.040 long-term play I think the question that
00:35:24.040 needs to be asked is if you are
00:35:25.520 importing a bunch of people who are more
00:35:27.760 dependent than average on the American
00:35:29.480 government for example or who are not
00:35:31.520 interested in assimilating to free
00:35:33.599 market values for example or Free Speech
00:35:35.760 values uh or or who come in and then
00:35:38.760 many of these people are going to get
00:35:39.680 married many of these people are going
00:35:40.560 to have kids they're going to marry
00:35:41.599 American citizens they're going to have
00:35:42.720 children who are American and then they
00:35:44.000 stay now you're talking about actually
00:35:45.960 generating a change in the voting
00:35:47.160 population and that isn't a right-wing
00:35:48.520 Point that's a point that was made by
00:35:49.560 Roy toera all the way back in 2004 when
00:35:51.960 he was a Democrat and he was making the
00:35:53.440 case essentially there was a demographic
00:35:55.240 wave that was going to shift the
00:35:56.319 electorate in the United States in the
00:35:58.160 direction of Democrats permanently now
00:36:00.079 the point that you're making is that
00:36:01.280 even as a long-term strategy that might
00:36:03.079 be a bad play because it may be that
00:36:04.440 these populations shift over time that
00:36:06.400 doesn't mean that that's not the intent
00:36:07.800 in the moment meaning wrong could could
00:36:10.960 have gotten it wrong they could made a
00:36:12.359 very bad strategic decision Antonio I
00:36:15.000 think we have to drop you off here any
00:36:16.680 closing comments you want to make and I
00:36:18.240 just want to thank you I know you've got
00:36:20.839 other things you could be doing in your
00:36:22.440 life but just on behalf of the American
00:36:24.680 people who I speak for here on the
00:36:26.079 program we want to thank you all
00:36:28.040 Americans for your service to this
00:36:29.760 country and I know that you are balls
00:36:31.599 and Strikes and you're going to let the
00:36:33.640 data speak so I just want to thank
00:36:36.640 you I would close this on this
00:36:38.839 conversation which is go look at
00:36:40.680 California Look at California okay
00:36:43.400 Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan came
00:36:46.160 California Ronald Reagan signed amnesty
00:36:48.880 and you know some 40 years later it is
00:36:50.920 now of solidly blue State and I think U
00:36:54.400 some us on this program I know you Jason
00:36:56.560 are Refugee from California because of
00:36:58.359 that because of some of those policies
00:37:00.520 and I want to be I want you to be
00:37:01.560 careful about this because it is it is
00:37:03.280 actually the tip of the iceberg man we
00:37:05.880 we have a very small sample of data in a
00:37:08.359 couple of States it's the tip of the
00:37:10.160 iceberg and so I don't know what the
00:37:12.280 unintended conse will be long term but I
00:37:13.839 can tell you what already happened in
00:37:15.200 America where an amnesty program
00:37:17.200 actually turned a very large State you
00:37:20.400 know from one one party another and I
00:37:22.440 want to leave you guys this thought this
00:37:24.240 is not political I'm not doing it
00:37:26.440 there's no political motivation in my my
00:37:27.680 mind this is about America it's about
00:37:29.440 securing the American democracy and we
00:37:31.800 will shine light onto the data when we
00:37:33.880 can we prefer these people to
00:37:36.119 prosecution and we're going to keep
00:37:37.720 looking we'll keep going and the data
00:37:39.720 will lead us and the truth will lead us
00:37:42.040 and it'll eventually come out in the
00:37:42.920 sunlight you're right but we're going to
00:37:44.240 follow the truth that's our primary
00:37:46.640 motive that that is that is our
00:37:48.920 operating parameter and what we're going
00:37:50.880 to do right on all right thank you
00:37:53.599 Antonio gra and Contin success and love
00:37:56.400 to talk to you in 30 days when you have
00:37:58.119 your next
00:38:00.000 findings you're a you're a refugee from
00:38:02.280 California too aren't you yes yeah we
00:38:04.280 took off in 2020 during during covid we
00:38:07.000 took off my company took off we we all
00:38:08.560 got the hell out I I was born in
00:38:09.720 California so I spent 30 uh 36 years
00:38:12.880 there before before I moved uh and yeah
00:38:15.000 they they certainly did a good job of
00:38:16.400 wrecking that state I mean I did the
00:38:18.880 same thing you went to oh I don't know
00:38:21.560 where you I'm in Florida yeah my
00:38:23.079 company's in Tennessee I'm in Florida
00:38:24.760 yeah got it yeah I mean it's just you
00:38:27.240 can't rais kids in California and you
00:38:29.040 just think about the crime and taxes and
00:38:31.480 what you're getting for your dollar it
00:38:32.760 doesn't make any sense I mean I don't
00:38:34.640 White House is off the zoom boys now we
00:38:36.400 can start to really open it up okay now
00:38:38.960 we can open up
00:38:41.599 the okay what do you guys think about
00:38:44.240 what you just
00:38:45.200 saw B I'll let you go first as our guest
00:38:47.599 yeah I I I wish the entire Trump
00:38:49.079 administration were rolled out as well
00:38:50.480 as Antonio just rolled that out is is
00:38:52.200 what I would say totally you know I
00:38:53.839 think that that is high levels of
00:38:55.800 competence and expertise and a
00:38:58.359 meticulous message that that is data
00:39:00.839 first and difficult for anybody to deny
00:39:03.040 I think that the success of the Trump
00:39:04.359 administrations the success that they've
00:39:05.720 had are taking the 80 side of 8020
00:39:07.359 issues and I think that the success of
00:39:08.960 President Trump in 2024 was that he
00:39:11.079 oddly became the Normy candidate he was
00:39:12.680 the guy who was returns normaly
00:39:14.280 candidacy and in the face of of Biden
00:39:16.240 and the bizarreness of of herness of
00:39:17.960 Harris and you know I think that as we
00:39:20.599 see many of Trump's policies rolled out
00:39:22.560 the ones that are rolled out the way
00:39:24.000 that Antonio is rolling it out are
00:39:25.920 incredibly well received by the American
00:39:27.640 population because they're seeing
00:39:28.599 serious people doing serious work that
00:39:30.280 needs to be done and the ones that are
00:39:31.880 not rolled out that way I think are
00:39:33.160 going to be a little more unpopular with
00:39:34.640 the American people and that that's kind
00:39:36.280 of I want president Trump to succeed at
00:39:37.839 a lot of these agenda items and I don't
00:39:39.520 want his his good agenda items getting
00:39:41.960 essentially railroaded and and Run Over
00:39:44.319 By by the by the bad rolled out of other
00:39:46.079 agenda items so you think thoughtful is
00:39:49.440 good and well thought out constructed
00:39:52.640 and communicated what what um when you
00:39:55.960 talk about this being done right what do
00:39:57.160 you think being done wrong it could be
00:39:58.720 done better I guess would be a generous
00:40:00.720 way of saying it what what could they
00:40:01.800 communicate better I mean not to jump
00:40:03.640 into the the pile of rakes that is the
00:40:05.400 the tariff plan but I think that the I
00:40:07.920 think that the way that the tariff plan
00:40:09.000 was rolled out is about as bad a roll
00:40:10.280 out as you could do um you know the
00:40:12.520 reason I say that is not just because of
00:40:14.160 my disagreements on the actual policy
00:40:16.280 I'll either be right or I'll be wrong on
00:40:17.680 that but the way that it was rolled out
00:40:19.560 with with very with with essentially
00:40:20.960 kind of a surprise announcement um I
00:40:23.319 don't mind a surprise announcement if
00:40:25.200 what is then rolled out is not replete
00:40:27.200 with with with sort of
00:40:28.839 contradictory justifications um you know
00:40:31.640 statistics that that are labeled one
00:40:33.560 thing but really are not that thing uh
00:40:35.680 and and so it just it opens itself up to
00:40:37.599 all sorts of critiques from every
00:40:39.119 possible side of the if you want to make
00:40:41.040 the argument make the full make the full
00:40:42.960 scale wellth thought aru argument and
00:40:45.040 then we can argue over whether it's true
00:40:46.640 or not but there's there's four or five
00:40:48.520 different claims that are being
00:40:49.440 simultaneously made about the tariffs
00:40:51.119 one they're going to raise revenue two
00:40:52.480 they're going to reshore three that you
00:40:54.480 are going to somehow retrigger the world
00:40:56.440 trading system
00:40:58.319 some of these are mutually exclusive if
00:40:59.640 you're going to if you're going to
00:41:00.760 reshore you're not going to raise as
00:41:01.920 much revenue for example right those two
00:41:03.640 things are are mutually exclusive and
00:41:05.280 they're both being trotted out at the
00:41:06.440 same exact time if you're going to put
00:41:08.079 out a giant chart that the president
00:41:09.319 holds up that shows tariff rates plus
00:41:12.480 unspecified you know variable uh then
00:41:15.280 what I'd like to know is what the actual
00:41:16.640 tariff rate is a as opposed to what the
00:41:20.480 calculation seems to be which was the
00:41:22.200 trade deficit with a country divided
00:41:24.079 into the Imports to that Country and
00:41:27.560 that that has nothing to do with the
00:41:28.720 Tariff rate I mean just technically
00:41:29.960 speaking it has literally nothing to do
00:41:31.160 with the Tariff rate and so what that
00:41:32.720 means is now you're boxed in logically
00:41:34.560 if president Trump wants to do a
00:41:36.319 reciprocal tariff reduction for example
00:41:38.520 how do you do that because he actually
00:41:39.760 has used a stat a statistic for the
00:41:41.520 tariffs that have nothing to do with the
00:41:43.640 Tariff rate and are actually just trade
00:41:45.680 deficits so the only way to actually
00:41:47.359 Rectify that statistic is to have
00:41:48.760 Madagascar buy a bunch of American
00:41:50.319 product for example in order to get
00:41:52.000 their their quote unquote tariff rate
00:41:53.200 down you know that that sort of stuff
00:41:54.760 seems badly calibrated even if you like
00:41:56.760 the policy for example all right yeah
00:41:59.359 unless unless from a poker point of view
00:42:01.760 they spent many months declaring they're
00:42:03.400 going to do tariffs and everyone thought
00:42:05.280 they were bluffing and said everyone
00:42:06.760 said there's no way you're going to do
00:42:07.760 tariffs it's like someone in poker is
00:42:09.119 saying I'm gonna play every hand I get
00:42:10.920 I'm going to be crazy you don't believe
00:42:12.680 them and they actually have to do it in
00:42:15.520 order to get the negotiating leverage
00:42:17.240 that they need to be able to negotiate
00:42:19.000 trade deals ultimately and they have to
00:42:21.480 look a little crazy maybe I mean that so
00:42:23.520 you're that's your position freeberg in
00:42:25.200 the 4D chess or trying to rationalize
00:42:28.040 one kind of rational reason for why a
00:42:30.319 lot of smart people would end up putting
00:42:32.200 that board up that poster board up where
00:42:34.160 to your point Ben they said that these
00:42:36.200 are kind of the the tariffs that are
00:42:38.680 being levied Upon Our Country when in
00:42:40.720 fact it is simply the math of imports
00:42:43.920 minus exports divided by Imports that's
00:42:46.119 what the number was and and and it was
00:42:48.359 and it was maxed out at that number or
00:42:50.280 10% and that's what they did so they did
00:42:53.160 that basically as a way in my opinion it
00:42:55.319 looks like and I'm just trying to take a
00:42:56.680 read on this
00:42:58.359 that um they're using this as a way to
00:43:00.280 anchor for negotiations going forward to
00:43:02.280 make the case we are declaratively
00:43:05.200 crazily off the fraking ship going to do
00:43:08.119 whatever the heck we want to do here in
00:43:09.559 this Administration now everyone takes
00:43:11.599 them seriously now everyone shows up to
00:43:13.720 the negotiating table and now they can
00:43:15.800 actually negotiate and then announce a
00:43:17.480 series of win after win after win and
00:43:19.480 say we got this set of countries to
00:43:21.440 capitulate today this is the deal we
00:43:23.280 worked out it's a totally unique deal
00:43:25.160 this set of deals we worked out today
00:43:26.520 this set of deals we worked out today
00:43:28.200 and basically getting all the trade
00:43:29.359 representatives to the table by making
00:43:31.400 the case that they're actually willing
00:43:33.040 to go all the way to the wall on stuff
00:43:34.720 so I that's the only way I can kind of
00:43:36.359 rationalize this roll out Ben that's
00:43:38.319 what it feels like to me for months
00:43:40.240 they've been very declarative we are
00:43:42.520 going to do tariffs bessent said it to
00:43:45.280 us on our interview letnik said it to us
00:43:47.280 on our interview and no one took them
00:43:48.880 seriously I did I did by the way I I
00:43:50.520 will say that I took them totally
00:43:51.680 seriously so much so that I called my
00:43:53.280 financial adviser after the State of the
00:43:54.839 Union Address and told them to uh [ __ ]
00:43:57.559 my my stock and bond ratio in my
00:43:59.160 portfolio because I figured that
00:44:01.040 something like this was going to happen
00:44:02.200 I think you went heavy treasuries yes I
00:44:04.960 I I I went light stocks I'll say that
00:44:07.800 and and and the reason for that is
00:44:09.640 because again I think that the thing
00:44:11.280 about President Trump is that you he he
00:44:14.440 may not you know be serious in every
00:44:16.520 single thing that he says but he is very
00:44:18.400 clear that when he says a thing over and
00:44:20.280 over and over there is no hidden
00:44:21.800 motivation and this is the part that I
00:44:23.520 always have trouble with with sort of
00:44:25.040 the the 40 chess reads on President
00:44:26.520 Trump there's almost never a hidden
00:44:28.240 motivation he pretty much just says the
00:44:29.839 thing that he thinks right it's one of
00:44:31.119 the things that makes him so popular and
00:44:32.359 authentic is that there isn't a 40 chest
00:44:35.079 game being played If he if he says that
00:44:36.920 he wants a thing to happen it's because
00:44:38.680 he actually wants the thing to happen
00:44:39.800 now the thing about President Trump is
00:44:41.119 he's also a realist so if a bunch of bad
00:44:42.640 headlines hit him he may then change his
00:44:44.440 mind and decide that he wants to drive a
00:44:45.960 truck directly through the center of the
00:44:47.720 tariffs because the prices are going up
00:44:49.079 too much on for example semiconductors
00:44:50.760 so one of the big exemptions from these
00:44:52.520 tariffs is in fact in the area of
00:44:54.079 semiconductors again there you see a
00:44:55.839 sort of couple of different
00:44:57.200 justifications that are that are
00:44:58.240 mutually exclusive that are fighting
00:45:00.040 each other one of them is the idea we
00:45:01.319 need to resore semiconductor production
00:45:02.960 because it's a national security asset
00:45:04.640 and the other is it's we need to raise
00:45:07.040 revenue on semiconductors so he Exempted
00:45:09.319 them which kind of you know kind of
00:45:10.720 Boles up the logic and I I think that
00:45:13.839 the the there are a couple of tells that
00:45:15.800 that isn't what's it may listen I think
00:45:17.599 it may end up being the thing you're
00:45:18.520 saying I think the most likely result of
00:45:20.720 these tariffs is that within the next
00:45:21.880 few weeks the headlines are not good
00:45:23.559 president Trump starts driving trucks
00:45:24.920 through the center of the tariffs and
00:45:26.599 then he starts getting wins from various
00:45:29.559 parties outside that allow him to find
00:45:31.160 an off-ramp on some of these tariffs you
00:45:33.040 know a company in in Belgium says
00:45:35.200 they're going to build a factory in the
00:45:36.720 United States he has them to the White
00:45:38.040 House they have a big ceremony and then
00:45:39.760 he says and as a result of this we're
00:45:41.000 now lowering the tariffs in sort of the
00:45:42.280 same way he did with with Colombia when
00:45:43.920 he said not the university the the
00:45:45.240 country when he said he was going to hit
00:45:46.680 them with tariffs unless you accept
00:45:48.040 these these illegal immigrants and and
00:45:49.800 then they did so that very well might be
00:45:51.480 the offer I don't think that's what's
00:45:52.480 going on right now I think what's going
00:45:53.880 on right now is the strategy that
00:45:55.920 lutnick has repeated expressed which is
00:45:57.880 that they actually kind of like the
00:45:59.200 tariffs they actually think that this is
00:46:00.400 good economic policy and that between
00:46:01.760 1880 and 1910 was an amazing time in
00:46:04.079 American history and and so they do you
00:46:07.040 agree um I I think that that is a bad
00:46:10.599 read on economic history because there
00:46:12.400 are a lot of confounds there that are
00:46:14.319 being ignored uh among those confounds
00:46:17.000 would be the fact that actually
00:46:18.400 Industrial Revolution yes so a few just
00:46:21.280 name a few in the industrial revolution
00:46:22.920 extraordinar high levels of immigration
00:46:24.680 by the way during that period so you had
00:46:26.280 an incredibly cheap labor base that was
00:46:27.920 actually coming in into the United
00:46:29.359 States at that time massive expansion of
00:46:31.960 the American population no income tax
00:46:35.280 capital a newly discovered continent
00:46:37.240 right like like like truly like many
00:46:39.440 many compounds right and by the way less
00:46:41.160 International Trade generally so tariffs
00:46:42.599 aren't going to have the same sort of
00:46:43.720 impact on Global Supply chains as they
00:46:45.640 would now where every product that you
00:46:47.400 buy has gone through 10 different
00:46:48.839 countries in 10 different ways and so so
00:46:51.160 no I don't I don't think that that is a
00:46:52.520 comp um but that doesn't mean that that
00:46:54.480 lutnick doesn't think that it's a comp
00:46:56.480 for example and and I think that the
00:46:58.640 when when it comes to you know the roll
00:47:00.359 out again a methodical roll out I I I
00:47:03.680 totally get the crazy man Theory and I
00:47:05.319 think that sometimes president Trump
00:47:06.680 does that I'm hoping that that's what
00:47:08.160 he's doing but a good example of an
00:47:10.359 off-ramp he could have taken if that's
00:47:11.559 the thing he's trying to do so yesterday
00:47:13.760 in anticipation of this Israel which had
00:47:15.559 very very low tariffs on United States
00:47:17.240 Goods anyway announced they'd removed
00:47:18.720 all tariffs on American Goods right
00:47:20.359 there were no tariffs on American Goods
00:47:21.640 anymore and the administration that
00:47:24.040 afternoon listed their tariff rate at
00:47:25.920 33% and then hit them with a 17% tariff
00:47:29.880 for a country that win and just use them
00:47:32.319 as an example of a great partner exactly
00:47:35.000 exactly didn't didn't Canada do the same
00:47:37.200 didn't Canada drop tariffs like the the
00:47:39.079 morning of they were on CNBC and they
00:47:40.880 said we're totally willing to go to zero
00:47:43.040 and then the anchors correctly on CNBC
00:47:44.920 were like well then why haven't you done
00:47:46.240 that already to Ben's Point Israel did
00:47:49.040 do that and but I think your theory Ben
00:47:51.480 is like absolutely correct if you make
00:47:54.000 this analogy to what he did with
00:47:56.160 overturning ro8 it is the same exact
00:47:58.480 thing he told us over and over again I'm
00:48:01.040 going to put two maybe three people on
00:48:02.760 the Supreme Court I'm going to overturn
00:48:04.480 it and then afterwards he kind of wiped
00:48:06.400 his hands through it and was like listen
00:48:07.559 it's up to you guys I had nothing to do
00:48:09.240 with it he will tell you what he's going
00:48:10.960 to do he told you he was going to do
00:48:12.280 these tariffs he's done them uh and I do
00:48:15.040 think there's something embedded in what
00:48:16.599 you said Ben which is I think he likes
00:48:19.000 everybody to come to Mara Lago or to
00:48:20.920 come to the White House and he loves
00:48:22.760 doing deals he's addicted to it he wrote
00:48:24.599 a book The Art of the deal he loves
00:48:26.520 people coming to him hanging out and
00:48:29.119 shth maybe you could give us your
00:48:30.920 perspective crazy man the crazy
00:48:33.599 grandpa uh or this is a negotiating
00:48:37.000 tactic everybody has to come through him
00:48:39.400 or lutnick believes it as he said very
00:48:42.319 clearly I'm going to add a trillion
00:48:43.920 dollars in taxes here what what do you
00:48:45.680 think is going on here because if when I
00:48:47.680 went through all the top people on the
00:48:49.599 internet all our group of friends uh who
00:48:51.799 are deeply in finance I can't find
00:48:54.400 anybody deeply in finance who's not in
00:48:56.200 the administr who thinks this is well
00:48:58.359 executed or a good idea what's your
00:49:00.079 thought let me start by saying a couple
00:49:02.280 things to use the Donald rumfelt quote I
00:49:04.920 do agree with Ben tremendously that this
00:49:07.079 was a known known we mentioned this last
00:49:10.960 episode Donald Trump has been speaking
00:49:13.160 about tariffs for 40 plus years yep so
00:49:16.680 this is not a new thing and I think that
00:49:19.799 he tried this in Trump one but to your
00:49:23.640 guys's point it didn't really go well
00:49:25.960 because he didn't have the the team
00:49:27.160 around him that had his back and so it
00:49:30.040 was inevitable that he would have tried
00:49:31.839 it in Trump to he said it and he's been
00:49:34.680 able to do it so if you weren't planning
00:49:37.920 for it whoever was vested in this
00:49:40.640 outcome you really needed to be focused
00:49:44.240 on this it was a known known and so
00:49:46.040 there was a little dereliction of Duty
00:49:47.599 if you were caught off guard I think
00:49:49.160 that's one the second is and I we've
00:49:52.200 said this all year since January one on
00:49:55.599 this pod we started it even with the
00:49:57.880 with that poly Market bet that I made
00:50:00.040 which is the Trump Administration does
00:50:02.280 not
00:50:03.400 care about the stock
00:50:05.640 market and by the way this the trade
00:50:08.680 actually closed out so congrats to all
00:50:10.400 these people that won $650,000 on let me
00:50:13.200 just explain poly Market put a betting
00:50:15.040 Market suggested by chaai haa they are
00:50:18.079 partners of ours Magnificent Seven
00:50:20.040 shrinks below 30% of S&P 500 in
00:50:23.680 2025 this was free money this was like
00:50:26.200 the stock Market giving out free money
00:50:28.400 but why did this happen this happened
00:50:31.160 because it was very clear to me early on
00:50:33.960 that the rhetoric had shifted to say we
00:50:36.960 care about Maga we care about people
00:50:40.079 that have working class and middleclass
00:50:43.240 jobs none of those folks are deeply
00:50:45.440 invested in the asset economy the way
00:50:48.319 maybe some of us are and so it was
00:50:50.880 directionally clear and by the way Scott
00:50:53.480 bessent what a cold ass quote yesterday
00:50:58.440 the equity Market selloff is a MAG seven
00:51:01.000 problem not a Maga problem so there
00:51:03.240 again
00:51:04.839 putting all of this into the realm of
00:51:07.200 this is a known known so I think it's
00:51:09.559 pretty clear one Trump has had a 40-year
00:51:12.160 view on tariffs they're going to go
00:51:14.160 through with this and they're going to
00:51:15.119 see it through I don't think you're
00:51:16.520 going to see this Grand capitulation two
00:51:19.559 they are okay with the volatility in the
00:51:21.880 equity markets and then three which is
00:51:23.680 the other thing that we've been talking
00:51:24.920 about a lot is where does this move our
00:51:27.960 practical financing cost what is this
00:51:30.000 right we've talked about this we have
00:51:32.480 trillion dollars we need to finance in
00:51:34.200 the next 9 months so the singular goal
00:51:37.839 in my opinion of the White House has
00:51:40.319 been move the tenure as aggressively and
00:51:43.520 as quickly as possible and look what
00:51:45.119 they've done as of yesterday it's
00:51:47.680 unbelievable what's happened in the
00:51:48.960 tenure you know you were kissing
00:51:51.640 4% and we talked about this if it had
00:51:54.040 gone in the other direction guys 30 or
00:51:55.880 40 bases points and it touched 5% you're
00:51:58.960 talking about hundreds of billions of
00:52:00.960 dollars of extra money that would not
00:52:03.559 have been found that would have had to
00:52:05.520 be printed right and now this is
00:52:07.960 hundreds of billions of dollars that we
00:52:09.559 will save so if we cut rates If the Fed
00:52:13.720 Cuts rates that's all predicated this
00:52:16.359 doesn't matter anymore no this is this
00:52:17.839 is fed doesn't control the back end of
00:52:20.040 the curve on the treasury the treasury
00:52:22.160 markets the government sells treasuries
00:52:24.079 governments will option 10 years the
00:52:26.720 auctions will clear at around 4% it is
00:52:29.480 an enormous like as an American what we
00:52:32.720 should all be thinking is irrespective
00:52:34.480 of what you think you know or what you
00:52:36.040 think you like about tariffs we should
00:52:38.240 all have a moment where we exhale
00:52:40.680 because the long end of the curve is
00:52:43.720 giving us a respit in a storm and we
00:52:46.680 should be incredibly thankful because
00:52:49.440 know what I'm referring to chop is you
00:52:51.160 said yesterday Jerome pal you're on the
00:52:53.240 clock so maybe you could explain what
00:52:54.559 you meant by that okay so this is that's
00:52:57.559 a different part of the curve I
00:52:59.160 understand it's a different thing but
00:52:59.960 I'm just trying to put these two things
00:53:01.480 together because those are the two
00:53:02.599 things were saying this action took will
00:53:06.280 enable now okay so let's play the ball
00:53:07.760 where it lies okay the Wall Street Smart
00:53:10.799 money thought this was a 250 billion
00:53:13.359 event they were wrong this is part of
00:53:15.880 why the stock market has reacted so
00:53:17.400 violently today this is a $750 billion
00:53:20.640 to trillion dollar event okay this is a
00:53:22.920 big moment in the market so what does it
00:53:26.599 create it creates the risk of a
00:53:28.520 recession how do you minimize that risk
00:53:32.000 that is all about how easy it is for the
00:53:35.359 average person to be able to borrow
00:53:37.000 money where is that dictated that is
00:53:39.760 more dictated by the fed and how they
00:53:42.200 price the front end of the curve so what
00:53:44.520 we need to have happen now is while
00:53:46.640 Scott is out financing $6 trillion do on
00:53:49.280 the back end we now need to get Jerome
00:53:52.319 pow to cut the front end and if you do
00:53:54.599 it aggressively enough you can introd
00:53:56.440 produce liquidity in a moment where
00:53:58.760 small and mediumsized businesses can go
00:54:01.520 and get financed to weather the storm
00:54:04.400 Jam I want to add on to your point just
00:54:06.079 so you guys know there's
00:54:07.960 roughly 12 to6 trillion dollars of
00:54:12.760 private corporate debt in America so
00:54:14.920 this is debt held by small businesses
00:54:16.799 medium businesses Partnerships that have
00:54:20.520 on average call it a 15% operating
00:54:23.200 margin so they're going to be under
00:54:25.839 pressure if there is some recessionary
00:54:28.079 risk to make sure they have access to
00:54:29.599 Capital and if you remember the
00:54:31.160 interview that bessent gave to us a
00:54:32.839 couple weeks ago he was very clear that
00:54:35.319 one of his mandates is to enable the Rel
00:54:38.799 leveraging of the financial system
00:54:41.000 meaning he wants to give Banks the
00:54:43.000 ability to issue more debt to introduce
00:54:45.520 more capital and more liquidity into the
00:54:48.000 markets by taking away some of the
00:54:50.119 regulatory restrictions that have made
00:54:52.440 it more difficult for the banks to issue
00:54:54.559 credit to business owners to individuals
00:54:57.559 so if they are successful in their
00:55:00.040 deregulatory efforts it will introduce
00:55:02.119 more liquidity into the market coupled
00:55:04.160 with deregulatory work that they're
00:55:05.920 making in the other parts of the
00:55:08.000 administration as this is their
00:55:09.319 declaration not mine their intention is
00:55:12.040 to make sure that that Capital flows
00:55:13.960 into building businesses building new
00:55:15.920 businesses underwriting new jobs
00:55:18.040 creating more employment that's the
00:55:19.720 theory that they're trying to execute
00:55:21.440 obviously it's part of this three-legged
00:55:22.839 stool but if it doesn't all work the
00:55:24.760 stool Falls over okay chamath give us an
00:55:27.720 example here and I'm trying to get you
00:55:29.240 to paint the entire picture here because
00:55:31.920 the Tariff cudgel is not making sense
00:55:35.000 it's not all good news right so let's
00:55:37.000 let's paint the let's so I'll give a
00:55:38.640 very specific example A friend of
00:55:42.039 ours runs a 100 plus year company I'm
00:55:46.599 just going to say it in generic terms so
00:55:48.200 that I don't betray his confidence but
00:55:50.920 problem and this is a business that's
00:55:53.160 been built over 100 years owned by an
00:55:55.280 American family in Incredible family and
00:55:57.520 they make products that we all know and
00:55:59.160 love and what did this action do so in
00:56:02.720 their example they're in a very
00:56:04.160 difficult position because they have as
00:56:07.000 David said a very tight operating margin
00:56:10.079 because they have to compete ferociously
00:56:12.440 against China and they've done
00:56:14.720 everything possible to maintain their
00:56:17.799 capabilities in America hire American
00:56:19.839 workers in the Heartland but still
00:56:22.240 compete against China it's tough and
00:56:25.520 this action today swings them from
00:56:29.160 profitability to a potential yearly loss
00:56:32.280 in a meaningful order of magnitude like
00:56:34.480 hundreds of millions of dollars so Jason
00:56:37.079 that's the other side of this tariff
00:56:38.839 coin so we have to find a way of finding
00:56:42.280 those examples and as Ben said excluding
00:56:45.400 them somehow or giving them reprieve
00:56:47.520 because that wasn't the intention I
00:56:49.079 think of what Trump was trying to do
00:56:50.559 yesterday that's an example of a company
00:56:52.839 that should be winning and should
00:56:54.640 continue to win and fight the good fight
00:56:57.480 against China and try to continue to
00:56:59.119 employ thousands of Americans but this
00:57:02.240 thing because they had some capacity in
00:57:04.200 some other countries not China by the
00:57:06.240 way got it blows the thing up and so now
00:57:08.799 you have to fix those things all right
00:57:10.240 Ben let me get you involved here I'm
00:57:11.559 going to play you a quick clip from Rand
00:57:13.760 Paul and I want to get your feedback on
00:57:17.440 executive power and then on terrorists
00:57:21.039 themselves and if it's a good idea or a
00:57:22.480 bad idea play the clip what's the
00:57:24.240 rationale for getting behind this
00:57:26.799 well one we should not live under
00:57:28.280 emergency rule the Constitution said
00:57:30.280 taxes are raised by Congress most
00:57:32.400 specifically taxes originate in the
00:57:33.960 house and come to the Senate so I'm
00:57:35.680 against emergency rule we are richer
00:57:38.160 because of trade with Canada and so is
00:57:40.680 Canada whenever you trade with somebody
00:57:43.039 when an individual buys somebody else's
00:57:44.839 product it's mutually beneficial or you
00:57:47.359 wouldn't buy it if the trade is
00:57:49.200 voluntary it's always beneficial there
00:57:51.960 is no Canada versus the US the consumer
00:57:54.839 wins when the price is the lowest price
00:57:57.319 tariffs raise prices and they're a bad
00:57:59.079 idea for the economy Ben your thoughts
00:58:00.559 on the two issues is trade good for
00:58:02.839 consumers this is what you know I think
00:58:05.079 is on top of everybody's mind that yeah
00:58:07.640 the whole Trump presidency and he won in
00:58:10.640 large part due to inflation and Biden
00:58:13.799 economics and that he was going to
00:58:15.440 reduce inflation and I think a lot of
00:58:17.640 people believe inflation's about to come
00:58:20.559 roaring back your thoughts on the two
00:58:22.039 issues well I mean obviously on a
00:58:23.039 macroeconomic level I totally agree with
00:58:24.520 senator Paul when it comes to the powers
00:58:25.960 of of the presidency I think that it's
00:58:27.359 pretty extraordinary that we should be
00:58:29.760 able to use the trade deficit as a
00:58:32.319 National Emergency sufficient to put
00:58:35.359 down what effectively amounts to a $700
00:58:37.640 billion tax increase on the American
00:58:39.839 people if you're talking about them
00:58:41.039 paying the price of of the tariffs on on
00:58:42.839 the other end and Congress you know I
00:58:45.079 think that if things get bad enough
00:58:46.760 there a bunch of you know streams
00:58:48.559 obviously here that cross one of the big
00:58:50.319 things here is that Congress is up for
00:58:52.319 re-elect in a year and a half and if the
00:58:54.880 Republicans lose Congress in year and a
00:58:56.319 half then whatever tricks president
00:58:57.720 Trump is is trying to pull in terms of
00:58:59.480 being able to rejigger the rate at which
00:59:01.599 we are paying back our our national debt
00:59:03.599 all that stuff goes by the wayside
00:59:04.960 because if Democrats win Congress pretty
00:59:06.280 much everything comes to a crashing Hall
00:59:08.079 and there are a lot of Republicans who
00:59:09.400 are in swing districts or in say R plus
00:59:12.280 five R plus 10 districts who are
00:59:13.920 suddenly going to feel feel pretty
00:59:15.480 vulnerable a recession takes everybody
00:59:17.640 with it it takes secretary bessent it
00:59:19.599 takes the president it takes J Vance
00:59:21.119 takes everybody with it recessions tend
00:59:22.640 to crush the president who is in power
00:59:24.799 at the time regardless what their
00:59:26.520 long-term plan is when they say
00:59:27.799 short-term pay for long-term gain again
00:59:31.119 I think that there are a few factors
00:59:32.599 here that I would like to see played out
00:59:34.760 for example if there is an inflationary
00:59:37.079 effect to the tariffs in terms in terms
00:59:38.760 of price does that mean that Jerome pal
00:59:40.480 is going to eject additional liquidity
00:59:42.079 into the markets by by decreasing
00:59:43.559 interest rates it's hard to see how I
00:59:44.760 mean he's holding the interest rates
00:59:45.760 steady right now without decreasing the
00:59:47.839 interest rates despite president Trump
00:59:49.599 basically blasting him publicly since
00:59:52.440 before he was even the president
00:59:55.039 formally he just the president President
00:59:56.280 elect that time so again it's hard for
00:59:58.480 me to see how all of this squares into
01:00:00.640 what looks like a a really
01:00:02.400 well-calibrated policy and and then
01:00:04.960 beyond that in the long term tricks that
01:00:08.160 we play with regard to the rate of
01:00:09.920 interest paying back our national debt
01:00:11.680 are not going to be sufficient to pay
01:00:12.920 back our national debt unless we have
01:00:14.160 robust economic growth and so a lot has
01:00:16.559 to be bet on the robust economic growth
01:00:18.559 out out earning essentially the the
01:00:20.839 levels of debt that we are are currently
01:00:22.400 racking up and while I love what doge is
01:00:24.359 doing the systemic drivers of our
01:00:26.000 national debt are not actually being
01:00:27.280 touched at this point by Doge I mean
01:00:28.640 it's it's the it's the means tested
01:00:29.839 welfare programs that are really the
01:00:31.200 systemic long-term drivers of our
01:00:32.680 national debt and Military I think would
01:00:34.400 be number two yeah milit milit military
01:00:36.880 as a percentage of of the of the GDP or
01:00:38.839 as a percentage of the budget has been
01:00:40.200 you know relatively stable and in some
01:00:41.640 cases decreasing since since the end of
01:00:43.720 the Iraq War true but that but that that
01:00:46.079 when when it comes to the means tested
01:00:47.079 welfare programs those continue to grow
01:00:48.839 as a percentage of the budget and over
01:00:50.599 time are increasingly unfunded yeah as
01:00:53.680 our population ages and the population
01:00:55.599 grows
01:00:56.440 freeberg putting aside executive power
01:00:59.119 in the midterms which yeah that that
01:01:01.480 would change everything what are your
01:01:03.760 thoughts on just inflation and tariffs
01:01:06.720 and the chance that this comes back and
01:01:08.760 explodes in the administration's lab
01:01:11.559 well I think there are three
01:01:12.599 consequences not necessarily related to
01:01:14.920 inflation that are just worth spending
01:01:16.880 time on one of which I don't think gets
01:01:18.680 talked about enough the first is just
01:01:21.559 the challenge of tariffs in general and
01:01:24.520 I shared this clip with you guys over
01:01:25.920 the group chat yesterday from Ronald
01:01:27.400 Reagan talking oh it's so funny I have
01:01:29.280 it chewed up I actually edit it let's do
01:01:31.000 that let's play this clip and get your
01:01:32.440 reaction and today many economic
01:01:34.359 analysts and historians argue that high
01:01:37.000 tariff legislation passed back in that
01:01:39.280 period called the smooth Holly tariff
01:01:42.240 greatly deepened the depression and
01:01:44.039 prevented economic recovery you see at
01:01:46.200 first when someone says let's impose
01:01:48.240 tariffs on Foreign imports it looks like
01:01:50.640 they're doing the Patriotic Thing by
01:01:52.760 protecting American products and jobs
01:01:55.400 and sometimes for a short while it works
01:01:58.200 but only for a short time what
01:02:00.319 eventually occurs is first homegrown
01:02:02.920 Industries start relying on government
01:02:04.960 protection in the form of high tariffs
01:02:07.279 they stop competing and stop making the
01:02:09.720 Innovative management and technological
01:02:11.760 changes they need to succeed in world
01:02:14.240 markets and then while all this is going
01:02:16.680 on something even worse occurs people
01:02:19.279 stop buying then the worst happens
01:02:22.039 markets shrink and collapse businesses
01:02:24.000 and industries shut down and millions of
01:02:26.640 people lose their jobs the memory of all
01:02:29.359 this occurring back in the 30s made me
01:02:31.240 determined when I came to Washington to
01:02:33.400 spare the American people the
01:02:35.119 protectionist legislation that destroys
01:02:37.720 Prosperity so let me just say three
01:02:39.440 things that I think are going to be
01:02:40.520 important consequences one of which
01:02:42.000 doesn't get talked about much at all the
01:02:44.359 first is the important point about the
01:02:46.559 decline in competitiveness that arises
01:02:48.440 when you use protectionist tactics like
01:02:50.880 import tariffs so ultimately in order to
01:02:53.760 be competitive in the market you need to
01:02:55.480 have a free market to test how good you
01:02:57.520 are relative to your competitors and if
01:03:00.279 you use tariffs or other taxes or other
01:03:03.039 government intervening systems to
01:03:05.400 distort the natural forces of markets
01:03:08.200 meaning there's a buyer and a seller
01:03:10.000 there may be multiple Sellers and
01:03:11.359 ultimately the buyer will choose the
01:03:13.680 best seller then you're creating a
01:03:16.680 disincentive for American Enterprise to
01:03:19.119 be more competitive we lost
01:03:20.799 manufacturing because we weren't
01:03:22.279 competitive in manufacturing putting a
01:03:24.400 tariff on other manufactur ing countries
01:03:26.960 does not make Americans more competitive
01:03:29.559 it basically gives American businesses a
01:03:32.240 crutch David so let's talk about
01:03:34.559 manufacturing so if I'm using a
01:03:36.240 traditional assembly line with low
01:03:37.760 efficiency systems I'm going to be more
01:03:40.079 expensive to make a device than a
01:03:42.200 Chinese Factory that's built with a lot
01:03:43.799 of automation high efficiency systems
01:03:46.440 Etc and so if I'm saying well to buy the
01:03:48.720 Chinese product you got to pay twice as
01:03:50.119 much because there's a tariff now the
01:03:51.880 American company does not have an
01:03:53.920 incentive to invest in autom
01:03:56.359 or building better technology or
01:03:58.200 adopting new technology to make
01:04:00.200 themselves competitive in the
01:04:01.400 marketplace so that's the challenge with
01:04:03.319 tariffs long term is that they distort
01:04:05.720 Economic Consequences that arise in a
01:04:07.880 traditional free market system the
01:04:10.559 second consequence I think is important
01:04:12.119 is under this gu and in the near term
01:04:14.240 the effect of some of these tariffs is
01:04:15.640 going to be the loss of revenue for a
01:04:17.640 significant chunk of the American
01:04:19.839 businesses in particular I'll use one
01:04:22.599 example people may not remember this
01:04:24.839 because it wasn't that big of a thing
01:04:26.279 but between 2016 and 2020 during the
01:04:28.039 last Trump Administration there was a
01:04:30.000 continued kind of tariff and trade
01:04:31.960 escalation between Trump and China and
01:04:34.640 during that time China stopped buying
01:04:36.720 American a exports and China is the
01:04:38.839 biggest buyer of American agricultural
01:04:40.599 products as a result the Trump
01:04:42.480 administration had to issue two support
01:04:45.359 payment checks to Farmers that totaled
01:04:47.839 $28 billion in 2018 and 2019 just
01:04:52.680 because of that China stepping out of
01:04:54.520 the buying Market American farmers
01:04:57.039 represent a large amount of the voting
01:04:59.720 block for the Republican party and so my
01:05:02.119 I think that the second consequence is
01:05:03.680 going to be that there is going to need
01:05:04.799 to be financial support which means
01:05:07.119 increased government spending if we
01:05:09.279 intend to keep the tariffs in place and
01:05:11.279 the global market stops buying American
01:05:13.200 exports that's the second Consequence
01:05:15.160 the third consequence which is the one I
01:05:16.839 am most worried about which I think
01:05:18.799 about a lot is China had the state
01:05:22.760 council meeting a couple days ago and in
01:05:25.880 that state council meeting they
01:05:27.039 announced a series of measures and a
01:05:28.640 series of steps that they would be
01:05:30.520 willing to take an IP infringement in
01:05:34.359 the case of retaliatory tariff
01:05:37.079 escalation in a trade War what that
01:05:39.520 means is that China May step up and say
01:05:41.760 you know what we are disregarding all of
01:05:44.160 the IP rights held by IP rights holders
01:05:46.279 around the world and they could steal IP
01:05:49.079 more openly more brazenly and because
01:05:51.440 they have a lower cost of manufacturing
01:05:53.240 they have a larger manufacturing base a
01:05:54.839 lower cost of power
01:05:56.160 they could basically take the only thing
01:05:58.359 that much of American Enterprise relies
01:06:00.119 on which is our IP rights and say we're
01:06:02.279 just going to well people might say oh
01:06:03.920 they already do that they already do
01:06:05.000 that they do it to an extent but imagine
01:06:07.559 if China just made copies of Microsoft
01:06:09.599 Word and started selling it around the
01:06:11.440 world for $5 yeah I mean they did that
01:06:14.160 internally for some period of time then
01:06:16.079 they started to respect it internally
01:06:17.599 but they've never done it great point
01:06:19.400 and shipping Disney films overseas
01:06:21.480 that's right and so now imagine if they
01:06:22.599 started taking all of American
01:06:24.079 manufacturing drawings blueprints
01:06:26.319 designs and they have all this
01:06:27.559 manufacturing capacity and they sold
01:06:29.039 everything at 10 cents on the dollar to
01:06:31.079 all of the global markets that the US is
01:06:32.880 now cutting trade ties with because of
01:06:34.599 the the Tariff escalation and China says
01:06:36.599 we don't care about your IP rights
01:06:38.079 anymore we don't care because you've cut
01:06:39.880 us off the rest of the world needs
01:06:41.319 someone that will sell to them I will
01:06:42.839 also say China One thing that's not
01:06:44.319 talked about which I'll add in seems to
01:06:46.440 have developed three
01:06:48.079 nanometer semiconductor manufacturing
01:06:50.240 technology which is going to go into
01:06:52.000 production in Q3 of 2025 and will end up
01:06:54.559 being in full production 2026 this will
01:06:57.200 move the base from Taiwan potentially
01:06:59.640 into China they are developing
01:07:01.279 lithography systems they are developing
01:07:02.839 Advanced semiconduct Manufacturing
01:07:04.279 Systems and they will effectively have
01:07:06.200 everything from energy to the minerals
01:07:09.000 to the manufacturing capacity to support
01:07:11.400 and service all and the software now all
01:07:13.319 of technology and so we are in a really
01:07:15.640 disadvantaged position if China does
01:07:17.359 choose in this moment to disregard the
01:07:19.400 IP rights of American businesses so they
01:07:21.880 they have the ability to to swing back
01:07:24.279 at us chamat you who wrap us up here and
01:07:27.279 yeah I'll take the other side of all of
01:07:29.400 this yeah I'll start with again there's
01:07:32.680 no point prognosticating when they're
01:07:35.039 just telling
01:07:36.240 you what they intend to do Nick you want
01:07:39.400 to play the clip I could see in the next
01:07:41.559 few years that we are going to have to
01:07:43.640 have some kind of a grand e global
01:07:47.680 economic reordering is something on on
01:07:50.880 the equivalent of a new Bretton Woods or
01:07:52.720 if you want to go back like a a treat
01:07:56.319 something back to the steel agreements
01:07:58.039 or the Treaty of Versailles I mean what
01:08:00.480 what is that just a kind of like
01:08:01.760 refresher what are we talking about
01:08:03.039 we're talking about commercial relations
01:08:04.920 between at the time 44 countries right
01:08:08.359 this is a big statement I don't think
01:08:10.440 that these kinds of things are said
01:08:12.240 casually at a Manhattan Institute
01:08:15.400 cocktail
01:08:16.920 hour and I think that people understand
01:08:19.880 if you're kind of like steeped in the
01:08:21.560 history of it how important these kinds
01:08:23.399 of statements are so I think take this
01:08:26.640 similarly to how I take Trump's rhetoric
01:08:29.439 on tariffs and I'm spending some time
01:08:32.359 trying to Now
01:08:34.040 understand how are the scenarios that
01:08:36.479 could play out because I think David is
01:08:39.238 right if you assume the status quo
01:08:41.600 meaning what are the risks but what
01:08:44.120 they're saying is we're going to
01:08:45.520 question this we're actually going to go
01:08:47.640 here and just totally rewrite that if
01:08:50.080 that happens as part of this all bets
01:08:53.040 are off in my opinion I don't think any
01:08:55.080 of us know with any certainty what a new
01:08:58.319 economic framework would look like and
01:09:00.439 if Scott is basically prepping himself
01:09:03.640 to say hey put me in coach I'm ready I
01:09:07.319 would take that
01:09:09.000 seriously Ben what should be let's talk
01:09:12.319 about onshoring and bringing these jobs
01:09:16.120 bringing these factories back to America
01:09:18.880 it seems to me a bit crazy that we're
01:09:21.679 going to make fast fashion and people's
01:09:24.359 Coachella aware and their anchor you
01:09:27.359 know USBC cables here pharmaceutical
01:09:29.960 sure we need that for strategic purposes
01:09:31.880 we obviously need military and chips but
01:09:34.479 outside of that is there some rationale
01:09:37.238 here when we have the lowest
01:09:38.520 unemployment of our lifetime and
01:09:40.759 everybody wants to come here you know to
01:09:43.040 immigrate to this country to doing these
01:09:45.560 tariffs and trying to create jobs here
01:09:47.799 that we don't necessarily need we have
01:09:50.719 too much employment right now in the
01:09:53.198 market and not enough bodies to fill all
01:09:55.600 the open job wrecks what are your
01:09:57.040 thought I mean I think one of the things
01:09:58.400 that's really fascinating is the the
01:10:00.320 kind of difference in messaging that you
01:10:01.560 hear between the treasury secretary
01:10:03.080 Howard lutnick and the Commerce
01:10:04.640 Secretary and the president I mean
01:10:06.080 they're all messaging kind of different
01:10:07.360 things I think secretary bent is making
01:10:09.520 the strongest case for for what's being
01:10:11.080 done with this sort of long-term what's
01:10:13.440 what is reordering look like and and
01:10:15.480 even there I'm I'm still lacking Clarity
01:10:16.960 on what a reordered World Trade
01:10:19.120 relationship actually what is the end of
01:10:20.560 the rainbow there what does that
01:10:21.640 actually look like when all is said and
01:10:23.000 done so that I can kind of grasp exactly
01:10:25.040 what that what he wants that to look
01:10:26.800 like um I think that you know secretary
01:10:29.520 letnik seems to actually just like
01:10:30.640 tariffs and president Trump seems to
01:10:32.199 have a picture in his head when it comes
01:10:33.840 to factories that that we're going to
01:10:35.560 you know Revitalize the steel mills that
01:10:37.159 we're going to be we we're going to be
01:10:38.520 doing the kinds of jobs that we did back
01:10:40.440 in the 1950s there sort of a Nostalgia
01:10:42.600 that that that President Trump has in
01:10:44.360 sort of his own mind about these sorts
01:10:46.480 of jobs that by the way nobody in Modern
01:10:48.840 Life actually wants to work at if if you
01:10:50.360 were to work at a Ford factory in 1953
01:10:52.600 in an non-air conditioned Factory
01:10:53.800 riveting for a living you would should
01:10:55.400 be quite unhappy and and you should be
01:10:56.920 very happy that actually there are
01:10:57.840 machines that do that now and and you
01:10:59.440 hear this kind of talk sometimes bandied
01:11:01.360 about not just with regard to offshoring
01:11:03.440 both with regards to technology and
01:11:04.520 machines I mean I I've talked to I
01:11:07.080 remember a few years back in 2018 I
01:11:08.560 talked with Tucker Carlson on my program
01:11:10.000 and he literally said that he would
01:11:11.000 outlaw self-driving cars because it
01:11:12.960 would it would get rid of white trucker
01:11:15.199 jobs you know Blue Collar trucker jobs
01:11:17.480 in in Ohio and Michigan and when I said
01:11:19.960 well that sounds kind of Lte he said
01:11:21.159 well the Lites had a point and and you
01:11:23.480 know then suggested that on the basis
01:11:25.440 safety he would ban it and I remember
01:11:26.960 asking him but those those self-driving
01:11:29.320 cars will presumably be more safe than
01:11:31.080 than humans driving said safer yeah yeah
01:11:33.600 and what he actually said was well you
01:11:35.280 know I you asked me on what grounds I
01:11:36.840 would ban it not not whether that was
01:11:38.480 true or not but yeah you know I I think
01:11:40.520 that that that is I think I think this
01:11:42.600 is the danger that particularly Tech
01:11:44.199 runs when we're talking about these
01:11:45.679 sorts of things is is to believe that
01:11:47.560 the the Animus for trade relationships
01:11:50.840 around the world or the the
01:11:53.120 anti-competitive nature of many of the
01:11:55.280 the activities that are being taken are
01:11:56.480 relegated solely to sort of the foreign
01:11:58.960 sphere I think that you could easily see
01:12:00.719 that turn on quote unquote job loss that
01:12:03.480 is caused by AI or job loss that is
01:12:05.600 caused by technological gain I mean the
01:12:07.520 truth is that if you're talking about
01:12:08.560 job loss in the manufacturing sector in
01:12:10.080 the United States the vast majority of
01:12:11.400 job loss in the manufacturing sector is
01:12:12.880 not due to offshoring it's due to
01:12:14.000 technological advancements manufacturing
01:12:16.199 productivity in the United States is
01:12:17.440 actually dramatically risen since the
01:12:19.360 since the 1980 okay so let's play
01:12:21.120 conspiracy theorists for a second
01:12:22.480 because okay you're right Ben like you
01:12:24.000 want that Clarity I want want that
01:12:25.480 Clarity freeberg wants it jcal everybody
01:12:27.719 wants it but if this moment if it's a
01:12:30.159 catalyst to your point where everybody
01:12:32.400 is forced into the room and Trump leads
01:12:35.040 a a grand bargain across the 50 or 60
01:12:39.080 most important trading partners in the
01:12:41.199 world what does that look like like it's
01:12:43.480 it's almost like okay we're
01:12:46.360 reestablishing something that's akin to
01:12:49.040 the United Nations and what the United
01:12:50.560 Nations was meant to be post World War
01:12:52.800 II but that institution has to failed so
01:12:56.000 this new thing exists purely on economic
01:12:59.280 lines and cooperation I don't know I I
01:13:02.400 struggle actually to your point to kind
01:13:03.960 of imagine what are the outcomes but
01:13:06.040 there's so many unbelievable outcomes in
01:13:08.719 that scenario if they were able to get
01:13:10.280 the top 50 commercial mertile countries
01:13:13.120 together in a room and say let's Hammer
01:13:14.560 something up I mean I totally agree with
01:13:16.040 that I think one of my questions however
01:13:17.600 is the if you take a look at at some of
01:13:19.800 the the examples that that Scott is
01:13:21.560 using there when he talks about the
01:13:22.719 Bretton Woods agreement if you're going
01:13:23.920 to talk about you know what ni did in
01:13:26.239 debasing the dollar Versa if you're
01:13:27.960 talking I mean Versa at least would be a
01:13:29.560 better example in the sense that you
01:13:30.639 didn't have a global Hedon at the time
01:13:33.560 if you're talking about the BR wood
01:13:34.520 system literally the rest of the world
01:13:35.840 effectively did not exist in the post
01:13:37.280 World War II era so what is everybody
01:13:38.719 going to bet on they have to bet on the
01:13:39.880 American dollar there's no other choice
01:13:41.520 by the time that Nixon decides to go off
01:13:42.880 the gold standard essentially he has to
01:13:44.880 rely on the organization of the Petro
01:13:46.880 Dollar in order to make sure that people
01:13:48.520 don't dissociate from the United States
01:13:50.360 what is the thing that's going to draw
01:13:51.880 people to the United States as opposed
01:13:53.800 to looking to a comp in competitor like
01:13:56.440 a that's a great question so what is
01:13:58.239 that thing what do you think that that's
01:13:59.520 a great to mind yeah I mean AI is the
01:14:02.840 only possibility which is why I think
01:14:04.199 the AI regime inside the Trump
01:14:05.520 Administration is so deeply important I
01:14:07.560 also think this is why I'm warning about
01:14:09.159 you know the possibility that the sort
01:14:10.760 of anti-free Market forces that that are
01:14:12.679 related to tariffs aren't just related
01:14:14.360 to tariffs in some quarters this is
01:14:15.520 where populism can kind of run out of
01:14:17.600 control and start to actually turn
01:14:19.199 against some of its Tech masters in some
01:14:21.000 of these cases and so one one of the
01:14:23.040 things that I'm very concerned about is
01:14:24.320 if I was talking Danielle Smith who's
01:14:26.000 the premier of Alberta the other day and
01:14:28.040 she was talking about the fact that
01:14:29.600 Canada like she's she's very
01:14:30.760 conservative Alberta tends to be a more
01:14:32.040 conservative area of Canada and she was
01:14:33.679 talking about how if Mark Carney were to
01:14:36.760 become Prime Minister of Canada instead
01:14:38.360 of Pierre POV that he actually is eager
01:14:40.639 for the Terra War because it allows him
01:14:42.040 to reorient toward China and away from
01:14:44.239 the United States and and there are
01:14:45.800 countries that absolutely would love to
01:14:47.199 do that I mean there there's a case to
01:14:48.920 be made that the EU would love an easy
01:14:50.639 offramp with Russia and China and use
01:14:52.760 this as an excuse as as a way of
01:14:54.360 reorienting
01:14:55.679 back toward Russian oil for example and
01:14:57.800 then Chinese markets because that
01:14:58.880 Chinese market inputs right I mean you
01:15:01.080 have lower input costs which makes life
01:15:03.719 better for Citizens and citizens like
01:15:06.840 cheap things they like cheap oil in
01:15:08.639 their cars and they like cheap cars
01:15:09.960 they'll be bringing by cars into Europe
01:15:13.120 and and the thing that I'm worried about
01:15:14.159 is when when I look at the for forget
01:15:15.800 about Europe and forget about Canada for
01:15:17.000 a second the the the tariffs that that
01:15:18.639 kind of shocked me when I looked at that
01:15:20.480 list were all the tariffs on the
01:15:21.600 Southeast Asian countries right all of
01:15:23.440 those countries where where where
01:15:25.000 production has been shifting out of
01:15:26.159 China to places like for example Vietnam
01:15:28.360 or Cambodia the the production has been
01:15:30.159 shifting to those places specifically
01:15:32.199 because companies know the United States
01:15:34.679 yeah because the United States is going
01:15:35.920 after China well now why exactly would
01:15:38.239 you manufacture in Vietnam when Vietnam
01:15:39.920 is going to be with a 46% tariff rate on
01:15:42.159 the basis that we have a 90 it's more
01:15:45.040 than that Ben it's like they've made
01:15:46.400 those Investments over the last five or
01:15:48.560 six years and so you have tens and
01:15:50.760 hundreds of you know millions of dollars
01:15:52.719 billions of dollars of sunk cost now
01:15:54.560 what do you do in that moment these were
01:15:56.520 specifically designed Ben to be a
01:15:58.040 diversification strategy Japan was
01:16:00.360 paying their companies to build
01:16:02.800 factories outside of China and apple was
01:16:05.040 doing India Vietnam to build airpods and
01:16:08.000 laptops and even the iPhone being made
01:16:10.280 outside of China that diversification
01:16:12.880 strategy did you did you watch the did
01:16:15.440 you watch the presser yesterday the the
01:16:17.560 worst part for me I only had one moment
01:16:20.239 where I was like oh gosh he stopped on
01:16:22.400 Sri Lanka and he goes Sri Lanka
01:16:26.360 good old Sri Lanka
01:16:28.080 88% amazing Sri Lankan but Sri Lanka
01:16:32.120 very tough on us very was like acting go
01:16:35.159 ahead Ben you can do yours you can do
01:16:36.719 your dueling
01:16:38.040 about a great Trump okay and that's the
01:16:41.639 reason why Ben Shapiro's podcast number
01:16:44.159 two to all in now because of the Ben
01:16:46.320 Shapiro Trump
01:16:48.360 impersonation Ben Shapiro Great American
01:16:50.639 have you been to the white house uh I
01:16:52.880 have actually yeah invited in this or
01:16:56.320 are you still Trump or
01:17:00.880 Trumper it was a nasty never Trump now
01:17:03.600 he's Pro Trump exactly I had the same
01:17:06.840 exact trajectory as JD Vans except I
01:17:08.440 didn't end up Vice President of the
01:17:09.400 United States um but you know the I
01:17:11.639 think that you know the again one when
01:17:14.239 we talk about the roll out the the fact
01:17:15.760 that for example the meme online right
01:17:17.239 now and I know we all kind of live in me
01:17:18.920 moral that the meme is the president and
01:17:20.320 JD Vance lecturing a penguin because on
01:17:22.320 that chart is the herd Islands have you
01:17:24.440 even apologized for eating all that
01:17:27.960 mackerel no no wait what are you guys
01:17:29.800 talking about there's an island there's
01:17:32.360 an island that got a 10% tariff but
01:17:34.280 there's nothing on the island except
01:17:35.719 Penguins yeah it's a St this is where I
01:17:40.480 start come on then have you even
01:17:42.840 apologized
01:17:44.480 okay you got no cards there no cards
01:17:47.159 this penguin has no cards it's just you
01:17:49.960 have no cards to play okay stop stop
01:17:52.960 you've got a great tuxedo at least you
01:17:54.560 show in a okay good stuff um oh my
01:18:00.679 God by the way I think that Ben's
01:18:02.800 framing of this thank you for that
01:18:04.440 because that was really helpful to me
01:18:05.920 you're right like if if we try to
01:18:09.080 reconvene a new Bret and woods we have
01:18:11.679 to have an anchor
01:18:13.760 asset so it's a really great question
01:18:16.159 what is that anchor asset it has to be
01:18:17.920 AI but then you know underneath that AI
01:18:20.800 thing we have these two very complicated
01:18:22.400 problems one is a meaningful energy
01:18:24.239 problem I've been talking about this now
01:18:26.120 incessantly we don't have enough
01:18:28.280 electrons we just don't and then the
01:18:31.159 second is what freeberg mentioned before
01:18:33.040 which is that we have a very delicate
01:18:34.840 technological supply chain to make the
01:18:36.960 underlying silicon we need for these
01:18:39.120 things neither are trivial these are not
01:18:41.880 things that can be easily solved yeah
01:18:44.280 the AI supply chain is electricity we're
01:18:47.120 going from one terawatt to two China's
01:18:49.159 going from three to eight over the same
01:18:51.800 time period just to be clear so they're
01:18:53.960 accelerating the second is rare earth
01:18:57.000 materials that we don't mine for we've
01:18:59.600 outsourced Mining and Doug bergham told
01:19:02.440 me an interesting stat he's our
01:19:04.760 Secretary of the Interior he said we
01:19:06.280 only graduate 200 people a year in the
01:19:08.440 United States with degrees in mining oh
01:19:10.400 God beginning in the 90s when
01:19:11.760 globalization took off we basically
01:19:13.920 stopped mining in this country and moved
01:19:15.440 everything to all the places because we
01:19:17.040 had this nimbyism we didn't want to have
01:19:19.000 mining in our backyard the third
01:19:21.560 obviously is the manufacturing of
01:19:23.520 semiconductors which we don't do the
01:19:25.560 components to do the manufacturing so
01:19:27.440 there's a company called asml which
01:19:29.560 everyone that works in Tech knows about
01:19:31.400 they have these Advanced lithography
01:19:32.719 systems to make the semiconductors they
01:19:35.679 don't sell to China so now China's got
01:19:37.679 their own
01:19:38.719 homegrown systems the worst thing we
01:19:40.840 don't yeah we don't make any of that in
01:19:42.760 house so we we don't mine we don't have
01:19:44.560 enough power we don't have the materials
01:19:46.600 and we don't make lithography and we
01:19:47.880 don't have any Fabs I said this before
01:19:49.600 but one of the biggest National Security
01:19:51.520 threats that we created out of nowhere
01:19:54.080 was when the Wall Street Journal was
01:19:55.639 allowed to do a detailed article on asml
01:19:59.600 and one of the craziest and scariest
01:20:02.840 stats is that there is a person
01:20:05.120 literally one person that can operate
01:20:07.600 these machines that are trained by asml
01:20:09.639 and then forward deployed and there was
01:20:11.159 a woman that was profiled and I thought
01:20:14.120 this is a national security risk you
01:20:16.000 should not be Ting who this woman is
01:20:18.840 she's going to be kidnapped ran Hall
01:20:21.280 exactly at the end of the day what the
01:20:22.719 US has is the way
01:20:25.520 we've got 70 billion parameters and we
01:20:27.320 call that an AI model that 70 billion
01:20:29.920 parameters if someone gets a copy of it
01:20:31.920 they've got an AI model so how much of
01:20:34.000 an advantage do we really have and the
01:20:35.840 other thing that we had meanwhile
01:20:37.120 China's got the whole supply chain and
01:20:39.000 now they're making their own models and
01:20:40.560 the thing that we had was our trade
01:20:42.400 relationships with all the places that
01:20:43.960 had all of these things that we actually
01:20:45.480 needed right this is super high
01:20:47.440 functioning yes it was it was quite high
01:20:49.000 functioning and and then and then beyond
01:20:51.080 that you also have the problem of what
01:20:53.080 happens if there's just less demand for
01:20:54.760 for dollars on the world stage I mean
01:20:56.520 the exit of the dollar as the world's
01:20:58.400 Global Reserve currency is going to have
01:21:00.280 some pretty nasty spillover effects and
01:21:02.679 and it's going to require the government
01:21:04.040 to start sucking in more dollars from
01:21:05.560 the American population in order to pay
01:21:07.480 off all of these these debts that we
01:21:08.880 racking up so I mean all these things T
01:21:10.760 like you could see a world where we
01:21:12.440 magic our way out of this but this is
01:21:14.159 what I've been saying to jcal
01:21:15.159 dollarization is what ends up happening
01:21:17.080 I mean this is what the stable coins I
01:21:19.320 think is set up to counter people are
01:21:21.760 now saying hey we're going to have
01:21:23.600 there's two stable coins acts that are
01:21:25.080 going around here one of them doesn't
01:21:27.480 require like know your customer
01:21:29.199 anti-money laundering terrorism stuff
01:21:31.320 which is you know tethers according to
01:21:33.520 many reports bread and butter and then
01:21:35.800 the other one is to domesticate all this
01:21:39.320 business give it to Circle give it to
01:21:42.080 stripe give it to American companies and
01:21:44.719 force them to buy a certain percentage
01:21:46.679 of treasuries and allow them to give
01:21:49.560 interest which the stable coin bills are
01:21:51.719 now debating if they should give that so
01:21:54.040 I don't know if you guys are watching
01:21:55.199 that but that would be way to keep a
01:21:58.159 buyer for you know our currency there's
01:22:00.840 an analog to this that I think is
01:22:02.199 important like when you look at the debt
01:22:03.840 to GDP of Japan one of the critical
01:22:07.000 questions is how can you have a
01:22:09.679 functioning economy at 250 260% debt to
01:22:13.320 GDP right and we're at sort of like
01:22:16.320 teens right 120 something whatever and
01:22:19.400 one of the critical advantages that they
01:22:21.239 have is that they export a lot of
01:22:24.040 incredible Goods abroad but they have an
01:22:26.280 incredibly deep domestic pool of buyers
01:22:28.880 for their own Japanese bonds and so
01:22:32.480 there's this permanent bid that exists
01:22:34.639 because the net buyer can be a Japanese
01:22:37.159 person on the margins and they're always
01:22:39.400 there and it's not necessarily a person
01:22:41.400 it's an insurance company it's a pension
01:22:43.719 fund Etc the thing that US dollar stable
01:22:47.320 coins does is it starts to replicate one
01:22:50.440 of those advantages which again if you
01:22:52.760 think about having a release valve for
01:22:54.639 the US economy and if we needed to all
01:22:57.480 of a sudden scream to 200% debt to GDP
01:23:00.719 the real question is where's the
01:23:01.960 incremental net buyer of the US Bond and
01:23:06.120 it could be the person that has to back
01:23:08.400 the stable coin which would then say the
01:23:10.880 people in charge of the crypto strategy
01:23:12.960 we won't name names no if anybody knows
01:23:15.600 anybody that legislation needs to be
01:23:17.679 incredibly permissive because to your
01:23:19.560 guys's point we would want the bid to us
01:23:22.600 treasuries to exist and be as ferocious
01:23:25.360 as possible right yeah but I don't think
01:23:27.040 you should give let tether do it until
01:23:28.600 they do anest until they do a proper
01:23:30.480 audit and they stop doing money
01:23:32.040 laundering terrorism and all the crazy
01:23:34.199 stuff I'm not going all the way there
01:23:36.040 but what Circle does is I think quite
01:23:37.440 structured and you know Circle that's I
01:23:39.920 mean I think that's
01:23:42.199 circles usdc that's their pitch and I
01:23:45.320 think the Trump family now just launched
01:23:47.120 their own stable coin this week so
01:23:48.800 you're going to see 10 stable coins that
01:23:50.440 is a great way to you know create
01:23:52.440 competition and um I still think it's a
01:23:55.520 really it's it's it's the right question
01:23:57.560 that this Administration has a
01:23:59.239 responsibility to articulate what is it
01:24:03.199 that makes
01:24:04.880 America the Lynch pin of the global
01:24:08.239 economy of the western
01:24:10.520 democracy of the world is we enter this
01:24:13.520 new era with this Rising power in China
01:24:16.239 and I'm not sure that there's Clarity
01:24:19.159 today what do you think it is I'll do
01:24:21.719 you think it's both of you guys what do
01:24:23.159 you guys think I mean it's pretty clear
01:24:24.679 what it is the reason we keep winning
01:24:26.639 and the reason China keeps stumbling is
01:24:28.400 because we have rabid entrepreneurship
01:24:30.480 and an investment and crazy investment
01:24:32.840 infrastructure the fact that we will bet
01:24:34.960 on entrepreneurs and allow them to
01:24:36.600 become billionaires or allow them to
01:24:38.000 flame out and start again tomorrow that
01:24:40.480 entrepreneurial Spirit of America is
01:24:42.560 what needs to be preserved that's what
01:24:44.480 created SpaceX that's what created
01:24:46.440 Circle we just talked about stripe we
01:24:48.600 need the American exceptionalism and it
01:24:50.920 has to be backed by recruiting AKA
01:24:54.639 immigration of brilliant people like
01:24:57.119 Sachs like freeberg like chamath who
01:24:59.520 were not born in this country you can't
01:25:01.199 do it just based on Ben chapiro and jcal
01:25:03.400 you need to be looking around the world
01:25:05.159 for the smartest people and then
01:25:06.719 plugging them into the entrepreneurial
01:25:08.199 system here that's the magic that's the
01:25:11.080 golden America David what do you think
01:25:13.159 it is that's a very good I mean I think
01:25:14.520 that's credible I honestly don't know if
01:25:17.199 I can be dismissive of China like jcal
01:25:19.520 says they keep stumbling and blah blah
01:25:21.520 blah I I think that's absolutely wrong
01:25:23.639 there's a very good interview um what
01:25:26.159 are those guys names from the Brookings
01:25:27.760 institution that do that podcast then
01:25:29.880 you might know these guys the three guys
01:25:32.199 might is touch is that who you're
01:25:33.480 talking about or that's a different
01:25:34.679 podcast I'm not sure it's not in the top
01:25:37.320 100 I don't know yeah it's not in the
01:25:39.679 top they talked about China and they
01:25:41.880 talked about actually the rise in China
01:25:43.719 where they 30X GDP per capita and call
01:25:46.159 it 30 years because they allowed
01:25:48.440 entrepreneurs are you talking about Good
01:25:49.719 Fellas Good Fellas sounds right yeah St
01:25:53.679 that's right Good Fellows Good Fellows
01:25:56.239 yeah I think that was it they had good
01:25:58.080 talk on a good talk no no it's Waldorf
01:26:00.520 and Statler I think that's their Nam
01:26:02.000 waldor and styler those the ho in Good
01:26:06.239 Fellows MCM Ferguson Nick find a picture
01:26:10.080 of Waldorf and styler for freedberg to
01:26:11.639 Jo oh they're so great they're so great
01:26:13.760 so anyway they made the point that
01:26:16.000 because China allowed the
01:26:19.199 entrepreneurism of the individuals to
01:26:22.600 let the market Run free and have this
01:26:24.679 throttle when they let the people run
01:26:26.080 free they let entrepreneurism Thrive and
01:26:28.280 then sometimes they pull the throttle
01:26:29.560 back jcal and did that and they crash
01:26:33.119 the whole thing now they've pushed it
01:26:34.600 Forward again and that's what drives the
01:26:36.840 growth and the Improvement in
01:26:37.800 productivity and this extraordinary
01:26:39.560 abundance in energy in mining and now in
01:26:43.199 manufacturing and it's I think going to
01:26:45.000 lead to a Great era of prosperity for
01:26:47.040 China it's pretty clear with or without
01:26:48.880 the conflict with the US they've
01:26:51.560 dramatically improved the conditions in
01:26:53.199 that country over the last 30 years in a
01:26:54.880 really profound historic way so I I
01:26:57.040 don't I'm not going to be dismissive and
01:26:58.480 say that they're stumbling let's give it
01:26:59.800 to B and then I'll tell you what I'm
01:27:00.800 dismissive so so first of all I think
01:27:02.280 that China does face some serious real
01:27:04.760 serious structural problems ranging from
01:27:06.320 demographics to debt um and and I also
01:27:08.600 think that yeah and I also think that if
01:27:10.679 you take a look at sort of the history
01:27:12.159 of economic fascism which is what
01:27:13.560 they're attempting to do which is sort
01:27:14.639 of cap you know using capitalist
01:27:16.520 methodologies in order to prop up a a
01:27:19.320 very tyrannical government that will in
01:27:21.119 a c exactly and and so for a short per
01:27:24.159 period of time that seems like that will
01:27:26.080 work and then and then the problem is
01:27:27.960 you can find yourself in a blind alley
01:27:29.280 fairly quickly and right now ai is not a
01:27:31.679 blind alley but we also don't know
01:27:32.880 exactly Which Way AI is going to develop
01:27:34.360 in the most profitable way I mean the
01:27:35.560 amount of money that's been poured into
01:27:36.920 AI has not yet been justified by the
01:27:39.040 amount of of complet net on the on
01:27:41.719 return on the on the actual investment
01:27:43.159 obviously and so if you don't this this
01:27:45.960 is the benefit of the American Market is
01:27:47.360 that you have everybody chasing
01:27:48.520 everything all the time and one of those
01:27:50.280 things is going to hit the the benefit
01:27:51.920 of the Chinese market is you have
01:27:53.440 everyone chasing one thing all the time
01:27:55.080 if that's the thing that actually hits
01:27:56.560 they'll do amazing but it's possible
01:27:58.080 that they completely miss it but the
01:27:59.560 problem is I think and this is where you
01:28:01.000 get back to the political in the United
01:28:02.400 States and the and the necessity of
01:28:04.280 avoiding a recession is that to me the
01:28:07.040 scariest thing that that is happening in
01:28:09.159 inside the Trump Administration is not
01:28:10.480 something that's bad when President
01:28:12.119 Trump was inaugurated there was one
01:28:13.360 picture that spoke of the in that that
01:28:15.159 that kind of summed up the inauguration
01:28:16.440 was President Trump there with Tim Cook
01:28:18.440 and with the and with um and with Zuck
01:28:21.400 and with Elon and with all the
01:28:22.480 billionaires behind him all the all the
01:28:23.679 tech Bros right behind him if there is a
01:28:25.760 recession what comes next is not going
01:28:27.800 to be salutory to Innovation to
01:28:30.000 investment to technology to anything
01:28:32.280 remotely like that and so the idea of
01:28:33.960 short-term pain it better be really
01:28:35.600 really shortterm the American people do
01:28:37.360 not have patience for this and if the
01:28:39.320 and if if if it goes sideways then what
01:28:41.280 you're going to get is a populist revolt
01:28:42.600 on the left and a populist revolt on the
01:28:44.360 right that is going to take down
01:28:46.320 everybody who is even remotely connected
01:28:49.040 with this idea of free market capitalism
01:28:51.040 and so I I think that one of the dangers
01:28:53.400 in in sort of attempting to manipulate
01:28:55.040 the economy this way is that we're
01:28:56.480 saying okay we're going to we're going
01:28:57.360 to try these kind of methodologies of
01:28:59.639 government control in which we rejigger
01:29:01.280 the world economy in this way and that
01:29:02.560 way and then we'll magic our way out of
01:29:03.800 it with with stable coin and AI maybe or
01:29:07.360 maybe the best way to do this would
01:29:08.760 actually be to allow the thing to thrive
01:29:10.320 that has always thrived In America which
01:29:12.000 is lower the regulations let people
01:29:13.560 innovate let people fail let people
01:29:15.000 succeed get the hell out of the way and
01:29:17.119 yes actually do the things that you need
01:29:18.520 to do in cutting government debt by
01:29:21.360 doing the hard things and and the only
01:29:23.639 way you're going to able to do all those
01:29:24.719 things is through continued succcess not
01:29:26.560 paying to get to some long-term gain
01:29:28.320 it's got to be entrepreneurship and
01:29:29.960 there are some subfactors of it in order
01:29:32.159 to have a vibrant entrepreneurial
01:29:34.159 Community you need to have immigration
01:29:36.040 that's why I asked Trump on this thing
01:29:37.800 on this program can we get green cards
01:29:40.520 can we get people who have degrees here
01:29:42.320 especially coming out of Stanford to
01:29:43.520 stay in the country he said yes he'd
01:29:44.920 staple them on the degrees great the
01:29:47.040 next thing is getting leaan out and
01:29:49.360 ending the wrath of Lina Khan we need
01:29:51.360 m&a because when you have m&a the the
01:29:54.199 companies get bigger the fact that
01:29:56.040 YouTube and Android and AdSense were
01:29:59.480 purchased by Google made it into the
01:30:02.320 massive success it is on a global basis
01:30:04.199 today and the fact that meta was able to
01:30:06.239 buy things she may not like it when
01:30:07.639 these companies get too powerful but
01:30:09.440 what Jack ma what happened to Jack ma is
01:30:11.760 the reason freeberg that I don't believe
01:30:14.560 a dictator will ever compete with our C
01:30:16.840 country if we stay entrepreneurial and
01:30:19.280 not socialist socialism is a culde sec
01:30:22.360 as you're saying Ben and it might work
01:30:24.320 for a short period of time but then
01:30:26.239 someone like Xi Jinping is going to do
01:30:27.960 what dictators do which is implode he
01:30:30.119 saw Jack ma get popular he sent them to
01:30:33.080 get re-educated and do some painting and
01:30:35.440 he took up oil painting he got rid of
01:30:37.239 every educational company and pull up
01:30:38.800 the chart of Chinese investment Nick if
01:30:41.040 you have it boom it just got smashed and
01:30:44.600 this is what dictators do they do what
01:30:46.520 Putin did he invades Ukraine his economy
01:30:49.639 goes off the rails and this is what xiin
01:30:51.920 Ping do always imp me a step ladder to
01:30:54.719 get off your soap box so I can ask Ben a
01:30:56.560 question Ben when you said that in a
01:30:59.760 recession definitely not that's exactly
01:31:02.880 right how come I have a passion for
01:31:05.600 something you guys have to give me a
01:31:07.199 hard time you go on your passionate
01:31:10.040 rantt signaling eightball what do you do
01:31:12.520 you just shake it and some stupid some
01:31:14.400 stupid
01:31:17.159 statement Ben AG American exceptionalism
01:31:20.119 M Ben and I that's it I'm leaving the
01:31:22.719 the program Ben and I are
01:31:24.639 let me rant against dictators for a
01:31:25.960 minute my Kudos go ahead Ben okay you
01:31:29.320 should just go rant about the Trump
01:31:30.880 Administration and get your cabinet
01:31:32.440 position go ahead Ben when you talk
01:31:34.639 about in a recession they go after tech
01:31:37.360 companies what can you just explain that
01:31:39.440 more just explain that I'm not sure I
01:31:40.880 understood that totally okay so so there
01:31:42.600 there there's a recession and president
01:31:44.520 Trump just the way that people tend to
01:31:45.960 think of politics is is not on a
01:31:47.440 granular level they tend to see it on
01:31:49.080 sort of a pixelated level because most
01:31:50.520 people don't engage with politics on a
01:31:52.320 granular level they see a s painting
01:31:54.159 they don't see all the dots they just
01:31:55.159 see Sunday in the park with George right
01:31:57.080 and so when it comes to a recession the
01:31:59.560 image that's going to come to mind for
01:32:00.920 the Trump Administration is that this is
01:32:02.159 an Administration that is extremely
01:32:03.520 friendly to business particularly when
01:32:05.480 it comes to Tech and so whoever is
01:32:07.600 standing next to president Trump if
01:32:09.239 there if there is a serious recession
01:32:10.840 gets nuked gets caught in the Fallout
01:32:12.960 and if that happens then you will see a
01:32:14.600 resurgent left led by a Bernie Sanders
01:32:16.440 wing of the democratic party not a sort
01:32:17.920 of technocratic Obama esque you know as
01:32:20.840 recline abundance liberalism wi you're
01:32:22.960 going to get a a urgent Bernie Bernie
01:32:25.360 ISM on the left that basically says
01:32:27.840 these rich people screwed you in order
01:32:30.040 to get ahead you can feel it because
01:32:32.040 you're feeling the recession they're
01:32:33.119 still Rich you're still poor and and so
01:32:35.080 what you really need is a complete
01:32:36.560 rejiggering of the American economy
01:32:38.440 along the lines of fairness and you're
01:32:40.119 going to see something similar happen on
01:32:41.280 the right by the way so my friend man
01:32:43.199 ketti who is the the former editor of
01:32:45.880 the the Washington Free Beacon I believe
01:32:48.639 he he has a great point about
01:32:50.080 presidential elections he makes the
01:32:51.280 point that candidates don't become
01:32:53.199 president unless they they run against
01:32:54.239 their own party uh that that it is in
01:32:56.960 order to actually capture the
01:32:58.440 imagination of the American people you
01:33:00.080 almost always have to run inside your
01:33:01.360 own party against your own parties you
01:33:02.679 saw this most obviously with President
01:33:04.320 Trump but this was clearly true with
01:33:05.560 Barack Obama it it was true to a certain
01:33:08.000 extent uh with with George W bush even
01:33:10.360 who ran a compassionate conservative
01:33:11.880 campaign against the sort of
01:33:12.960 hard-hearted Gingrich Dole Republicans
01:33:15.960 it's Clinton Clint Clinton for sure did
01:33:17.560 this so I I think it's a great point
01:33:19.080 because then you have to start thinking
01:33:20.440 okay look at the we're turning the right
01:33:22.040 side of the aisle now let's say that you
01:33:23.080 have a politician on the right side of
01:33:24.239 the aisle what does he run against in
01:33:26.360 the TR because Trump has obviously taken
01:33:27.840 command tremendous command of the
01:33:28.960 Republican base and the Republican party
01:33:30.719 what is there to run against well if
01:33:31.880 there's an economic downturn do you
01:33:33.600 think that they're going to run against
01:33:34.600 Trump being not capitalist enough or do
01:33:36.600 they think they're going to run against
01:33:37.679 Trump being too capitalist too friendly
01:33:40.440 exactly and that's how you get a
01:33:41.520 populist Uprising on the right and what
01:33:43.159 you end up with is a horseshoe Theory
01:33:44.520 politics where both parties are in favor
01:33:46.560 of right both parties are in favor of
01:33:48.800 Lena Khan and by the way this is not a
01:33:50.520 rarity I mean I I think I think I think
01:33:53.320 that president is is an amazingly
01:33:55.280 brilliant guy he has also expressed kind
01:33:56.920 of public support for Lena Khan from
01:33:58.320 time to time right and that's inside the
01:34:00.119 Republican party and on the left
01:34:01.440 obviously there's tremendous support for
01:34:02.719 Lena Khan so if what we're saying here
01:34:04.199 is one of the things we need is not Lena
01:34:06.080 Khan we should be very careful not to
01:34:07.920 step on the rake and and then the thing
01:34:09.639 that hits you in the face is Lena Khan
01:34:11.199 right yeah right and this is why I said
01:34:13.000 my contrarian bet for this year was this
01:34:15.000 rise in uh socialist policy and the
01:34:18.080 response to some of the actions the
01:34:20.239 administration might take but how do we
01:34:23.000 avoid making the bottom half of society
01:34:26.159 feel included in all this wealth
01:34:29.480 generation Etc like what what is the
01:34:31.920 plan here is it Universal Health Care is
01:34:34.639 it lowering their taxes I mean the
01:34:36.280 administration says no taxes for people
01:34:38.159 under 150k we have to give something to
01:34:41.560 the working man and woman of this
01:34:43.320 country the people who feel that they
01:34:44.960 can't get rich who can't get to the
01:34:46.440 middle class does anybody here have a
01:34:48.360 suggestion for that I mean I do I
01:34:49.800 actually do have a suggestion and it's
01:34:51.119 it's actually shockingly easy president
01:34:53.000 Trump has a has a visceral connection to
01:34:56.040 blue collar workers in this country
01:34:57.600 clearly has a visceral connection he
01:34:59.560 should stop preaching that blue collar
01:35:01.000 workers are getting screwed and start
01:35:02.520 preaching that they're succeeding
01:35:04.119 because it's actually true truth okay
01:35:06.040 yes yes I mean I think that the the the
01:35:07.639 FIB the politicians always make Bank on
01:35:10.119 is the idea that for example the middle
01:35:11.560 class in America is completely dissolved
01:35:13.159 that is not statistically true the
01:35:15.080 middle class has turned into the upper
01:35:16.880 middle class okay and and actually all
01:35:19.520 Americans I say this on my show all the
01:35:21.280 time people have this again this sort of
01:35:24.000 eyed view of the 1950s which again was a
01:35:26.000 historical outlier because the rest of
01:35:27.239 the world didn't exist it been destroyed
01:35:28.760 but they also have this bizarre idea
01:35:30.760 that that you were better off to be 30
01:35:32.400 years old in 1980 than you are to be 30
01:35:34.400 years old in 2025 and all I can say is
01:35:36.320 in 1980 the only dude with a cell phone
01:35:37.719 was Gordon Gecko and he was a shoe box
01:35:39.040 and he was holding it to his head okay
01:35:40.719 the reality is that everything in your
01:35:42.719 life is better in 2025 on a material
01:35:45.199 economic level than it was in 1980 and
01:35:48.600 the the lie that politicians tell in
01:35:50.199 order to gain power is they say you're
01:35:52.600 you're getting screwed somebody is
01:35:53.800 screwing you I can unscrew the screwing
01:35:56.400 and and so there's there's this constant
01:35:58.159 sort of Race To The Bottom in terms of
01:35:59.679 this rhetoric and what you end up with
01:36:01.320 is in the end what can I promise you
01:36:04.159 that that I can then blame somebody else
01:36:05.920 for not having fulfilled the promise
01:36:07.679 president Trump I think could avoid that
01:36:09.199 because of this unique connection that
01:36:10.280 he has with bluecollar people where he
01:36:11.920 could say listen we're all on the same
01:36:13.679 side here right what we're doing here is
01:36:15.080 innovation I thought the most important
01:36:16.560 line that I heard from president Trump
01:36:17.920 during his his victory speech the night
01:36:19.760 that he won was he when he said to Elon
01:36:21.639 and it was kind of a throw line when he
01:36:22.960 said we love our Geniuses he said we
01:36:24.800 love our Geniuses and I thought yes
01:36:26.639 that's the thing we
01:36:27.800 need celebrate success celebrate
01:36:30.280 entrepreneur and this could be you and
01:36:32.639 and not and we're going to have hiring
01:36:33.920 programs you as Mark andreon has talked
01:36:35.639 about we need to have hiring programs
01:36:36.880 that are that are specifically designed
01:36:38.159 to find the best people not just abroad
01:36:39.960 but also in the United States who might
01:36:41.760 be under service in in rural areas of
01:36:44.040 the country or in Blue Collar areas of
01:36:45.600 the country find the next JD Vans find
01:36:47.560 the next guy who really needs you know
01:36:49.400 that that hand up like all those things
01:36:51.239 can be done a rising tide will lift all
01:36:53.239 [ __ ]
01:36:54.119 but this is the problem with the
01:36:55.159 short-term pain plan Americans have a
01:36:58.239 long memory and when it comes to
01:37:00.000 politics I think this happened with the
01:37:01.679 Biden Administration uh poit people
01:37:04.560 their relationship with politicians is
01:37:05.880 sort of like a married couple and and
01:37:07.960 Good married couples you know they kind
01:37:09.400 of talk through the the minor problems
01:37:10.880 that they're having in their marriage
01:37:11.920 and then and then things you know
01:37:12.960 continue to maintain and grow and get
01:37:14.520 better bad married couples what happens
01:37:16.639 is that they sort of ignore that the
01:37:18.080 kind of minor annoyances for years at a
01:37:19.840 time and then something bad happens and
01:37:21.320 the bottom just goes right out and the
01:37:23.560 this is the thing that I'm afraid of for
01:37:24.679 the Trump Administration everybody's
01:37:25.880 willing to ignore the things that are
01:37:27.199 kind of mildly annoying like penguins at
01:37:28.679 the White House or whatever uh up until
01:37:30.440 the point where there's a serious
01:37:31.360 recession at that point everybody kind
01:37:33.600 of looks around and goes why are we even
01:37:34.960 doing this I think that's exactly what
01:37:36.119 happened with Biden with the Afghanistan
01:37:37.320 withdrawal for example making a mistep
01:37:39.719 is the is the it's why I'm being
01:37:41.440 critical of the tariffs it's not because
01:37:42.599 I want Trump to lose it's because I want
01:37:43.800 Trump to win right I think he's doing
01:37:45.080 too many important things like the stuff
01:37:47.400 that Antonio there too many important
01:37:49.040 things happening to to take to roll the
01:37:52.040 dice on a strategy isn't even being
01:37:54.719 articulated if you're going to make the
01:37:56.480 case for a long-term gain I need to know
01:37:58.080 what the long-term gain is so I can make
01:37:59.520 the case to the American public as to
01:38:01.119 why they should endure the short-term
01:38:02.320 pain you know you're having surgery
01:38:03.440 because after the surgery you're going
01:38:04.480 to feel better but if I say you're
01:38:05.639 having surgery it's going to be some
01:38:06.480 short-term pain you say okay how am I
01:38:08.000 going to feel after the surgery and say
01:38:09.199 well I don't know you know maybe could
01:38:12.960 maybe who knows then why am I having
01:38:15.119 surgery we have so many job openings we
01:38:16.960 have the lowest unemployment of our
01:38:18.480 lifetime as you said consumers today can
01:38:21.280 get and live an incredible lifestyle
01:38:23.719 that the rich didn't have in 1980 the
01:38:25.760 car you can buy today can drive itself
01:38:27.960 for 20 30 40K you can buy use Tesla and
01:38:31.040 have this car that's better than any car
01:38:32.840 made in the last 50 years so you got
01:38:34.880 keep a positive then think about
01:38:35.920 generation tool belt you've got all
01:38:37.880 these you know plumbing jobs electrician
01:38:40.159 jobs construction jobs that pay
01:38:42.239 massively hourly wages that are
01:38:44.719 available for people today we have too
01:38:47.920 many job openings today and you never
01:38:49.760 hear Trump say that to your point it's
01:38:51.159 always this like everything's a disaster
01:38:53.480 I'll save you when in fact you don't
01:38:55.040 need saving go ahead free bir I'll
01:38:56.719 answer joff's earlier question about
01:38:59.560 what America can anchor to to attract
01:39:02.560 the rest of the world and I think it's
01:39:04.440 what's been the American story from the
01:39:07.119 beginning which is ambition we pioneered
01:39:10.119 the West we launched the Industrial
01:39:13.040 Revolution we went to space we landed on
01:39:15.840 the moon we had the Manhattan Project we
01:39:20.119 unleashed the information technology
01:39:23.560 Revolution with the development of the
01:39:26.199 transistor the ambition is what's been
01:39:29.800 kind of consumed by China in the last 20
01:39:32.960 years they've built 30,000 miles of
01:39:34.800 highspeed rail in the next 15 years
01:39:37.400 they're going to add more electricity
01:39:40.400 production capacity than the United
01:39:42.960 States times two has
01:39:45.400 today there's nothing short of ambition
01:39:49.199 coming out of China and it's what we're
01:39:51.199 lacking all of our political gambits all
01:39:54.199 of our debates are all centered around
01:39:57.639 what we're trying to fix that went wrong
01:39:59.119 in the past what we did wrong and what
01:40:01.239 we got to do to make it right and we
01:40:03.159 don't talk at all about the ambition of
01:40:04.840 where we can lead the world to next
01:40:06.320 China's the only one that's doing that
01:40:08.159 and I think that's where we need to kind
01:40:09.760 of have a bit of a important pivot on
01:40:12.199 the global stage if we want to be able
01:40:13.880 to kind of attract partners and also to
01:40:16.679 have Americans think outside of this
01:40:19.000 week where are we headed and I just I
01:40:21.199 don't know I mean I don't know if you
01:40:22.080 guys agree but I just feel like that's
01:40:23.040 one of the the key things that we've
01:40:24.360 kind of lost track of nerk put out a a
01:40:26.880 study just like this is very tactical
01:40:29.280 but it's part and partial of what you
01:40:31.520 and Jason are talking about do you guys
01:40:33.320 know that about 25% of all of our
01:40:37.280 utility workers in America became
01:40:39.360 eligible for retirement between 2017 and
01:40:42.199 2022 I did not no so most of the people
01:40:45.920 56% of all utility workers now have less
01:40:48.360 than a decade of experience you know
01:40:49.840 what that's resulted in in 2021 the
01:40:52.520 average Us customer of of an electric
01:40:55.599 utility experiened seven and a half
01:40:57.560 hours of service interruptions and it's
01:40:59.560 just
01:41:00.360 growing uh I think the average plumers
01:41:02.800 age 50 something we can't get people to
01:41:06.119 become plumbers nurk says that 19 States
01:41:08.719 now in the United States can face
01:41:10.000 rolling blackouts during normal Peak
01:41:12.280 conditions if these issues aren't
01:41:13.599 addressed and by the way this is that's
01:41:15.400 a human capital problem but if you
01:41:17.920 multiply that by 10 and 20 and 30 times
01:41:20.520 there was a different tweet I don't know
01:41:22.000 Nick if you could find it
01:41:23.760 that talked about an organization trying
01:41:25.639 to find people to help build nuclear
01:41:27.119 submarines did you guys see this quote
01:41:29.400 where they needed 100,000 people to
01:41:32.360 build nuclear subs in the United States
01:41:35.280 and they could barely find like a few
01:41:38.000 hundred yeah we we need to get better at
01:41:40.880 this stuff I mean the good news is we're
01:41:42.760 we're going to have robots to do this
01:41:44.119 Ben uh you know if I run for president
01:41:46.320 I'm one of the few people here on the
01:41:47.480 Pod who can uh my position is going to
01:41:50.400 be build three new cities with
01:41:53.760 five million homes in each because you
01:41:55.320 know starter homes families can't buy
01:41:56.760 starter homes you ever consider running
01:41:58.599 for office and if you did what would be
01:41:59.920 your platform I mean it would be pretty
01:42:01.400 horrifying to run for office it seems
01:42:02.719 like a terrible job and I think the root
01:42:04.520 age to run for presidents is now in your
01:42:06.480 70s so I have like three decades to
01:42:08.280 consider it but you know if if I were
01:42:11.080 going to run I I would be running on the
01:42:13.840 basic idea that in this country the only
01:42:16.760 thing that you are promised is is the
01:42:18.360 adventure and and I'm not going to make
01:42:20.960 you promises that I'm not going to lie
01:42:23.440 to you I'm not going to make you
01:42:24.239 promises that I can't keep about how I'm
01:42:26.080 going to fix your life because the truth
01:42:27.440 is I really can't all I can do is help
01:42:29.520 get the obstacles out of the way so you
01:42:30.840 can fix your life and you can make your
01:42:32.199 life better and I can help break the
01:42:33.800 institutions that have a strangle hold
01:42:36.040 on on your future and and there when
01:42:37.520 you're talking about electricians and
01:42:38.719 plumbers the truth is that we have set
01:42:40.280 up an enormous con game that is our
01:42:42.480 higher education system particularly in
01:42:44.040 the liberal arts subsidized by the
01:42:45.960 taxpayer when most jobs that that we're
01:42:48.679 talking about right here do not require
01:42:49.840 a college degree there's so many things
01:42:51.679 that that the Trump Administration
01:42:52.880 should be doing and is doing that again
01:42:54.599 that are great that they could break the
01:42:56.639 strangle hold on some of these things
01:42:58.159 that allow for more opportunity but I
01:43:00.119 think the thing that people really you
01:43:01.760 know the thing that I would say that I I
01:43:03.360 really think that maybe no other
01:43:04.320 politician would say and I can say
01:43:05.280 because I'm not a politician is your
01:43:06.960 future is re in America your future is
01:43:09.639 in your hands it is not in somebody
01:43:11.719 else's hands it is your responsibility
01:43:13.760 it is your responsibility to go out and
01:43:15.599 strive it is your responsibility to go
01:43:17.280 and succeed we want you to be able to to
01:43:19.679 try again if you fail but we want you to
01:43:22.119 go and we want you to try ruged
01:43:24.840 individualism and also and also the you
01:43:26.960 know the the kind of case that that that
01:43:29.080 was being made a little bit earlier
01:43:30.520 about China that that basically China is
01:43:33.040 saying that it can do things the one of
01:43:35.599 the things that that drives me up a wall
01:43:37.000 is when politicians say I created X jobs
01:43:39.320 or or we created X jobs you didn't
01:43:41.679 create a job okay the government does
01:43:43.840 not create jobs the government can take
01:43:45.280 money from people and then give it to
01:43:46.520 other people but it is only
01:43:48.000 entrepreneurs who can create jobs and so
01:43:50.760 the the way that you fight China off is
01:43:52.800 not by the power of a centralized
01:43:54.480 government directing people in a
01:43:55.719 particular direction the way that you
01:43:56.840 fight off China is by unleashing the
01:43:59.239 collective knowledge wisdom and ambition
01:44:01.199 of the American people on an individual
01:44:02.880 level to go out and do all of these
01:44:04.639 unbelievable things and that that would
01:44:06.239 be the promise that I'd make to the
01:44:07.159 American people is I'll get everybody
01:44:08.320 the hell out of your way so you can
01:44:09.280 succeed that that would be the only
01:44:10.400 thing I I promise guys we got um
01:44:12.440 breaking news here it turns out the T
01:44:15.080 more reciprocal tariffs have dropped
01:44:17.199 look at this complaining about the
01:44:19.480 docket jcal has put a 500% reciprocal to
01:44:23.280 on that tariff on that purchasing dogs
01:44:25.920 from a breeders is now 100% tariff
01:44:28.280 freedberg oh that's pretty that's pretty
01:44:30.679 stiff and chamath has put one on Laura
01:44:33.040 Piana slippers yeah too many people have
01:44:35.080 them 200% tariff and uh oh looks like
01:44:38.280 Ben shapira got in on it having Candace
01:44:40.080 Owens on your podcast is now at
01:44:43.599 200% Ben what are you doing here guys
01:44:46.679 unkind wait what's the Palmer lucky one
01:44:48.880 can you can you read that lucky has put
01:44:50.639 a thousand this is the biggest one that
01:44:52.480 just dropped th% tariff I'm working with
01:44:54.880 jcal
01:44:57.040 for chamath poopa chairman dictator wait
01:45:00.880 I have to do you want to hear about oh
01:45:02.440 would you like to do a little memory L
01:45:03.520 we got so much show here I'm trying to
01:45:04.800 get this out but okay by way I created a
01:45:06.920 a poly Market on
01:45:09.000 GDP oh annualized GDP growth in Q3 of
01:45:12.119 this year being below five negative five
01:45:14.119 per. negative five% yeah that's brutal
01:45:19.119 check it out on Market what's the
01:45:21.000 probability of that happening make your
01:45:22.400 bets oh make your Bets with our partner
01:45:25.000 poly
01:45:26.400 Market chamath do you want to do Victory
01:45:28.800 lab we're to wrap here what do you want
01:45:29.960 to do well I actually think it's fun
01:45:31.599 because we're going to kick off a
01:45:33.000 different poly market around this
01:45:34.840 because I think it's interesting so the
01:45:36.440 thing that we haven't talked about is
01:45:38.360 with all of the
01:45:40.000 tariffs with all of the
01:45:42.800 financing questions with all of the
01:45:45.480 recession questions shortterm rates
01:45:47.440 long-term rates the one thing that we
01:45:49.040 haven't sufficiently talked about it's
01:45:51.719 not really in the Press but needs to be
01:45:53.360 talked about is there is a tremendous
01:45:55.360 amount of corporate debt that supports
01:45:57.639 these businesses
01:45:59.199 today and you would say well if
01:46:02.080 long-term rates go
01:46:04.199 down there's no real risk but the Tariff
01:46:08.159 picture actually impacts revenues right
01:46:11.800 and the problem with that is that
01:46:13.199 there's a lot of companies that have
01:46:14.800 debt covenants tied to revenue and
01:46:18.119 iida and so this is what I spoke about
01:46:20.880 at the beginning of January which is
01:46:23.880 the one risk that is
01:46:26.360 uncontrollable is what happens to
01:46:29.320 corporate debt and could we see a wave
01:46:32.920 of defaults and a wave of action Nick
01:46:35.280 you may want to just play the clip and
01:46:36.679 we can talk about what we can do about
01:46:38.360 this this was my pick for the best
01:46:40.400 investment idea oh go all right here we
01:46:43.599 go from what do you got let me preface
01:46:45.760 this by saying that this is a pick that
01:46:49.080 92 times out of a 100 goes to absolute
01:46:52.480 zero and six out of the remaining eight
01:46:56.639 times you make 10 extra money and then
01:46:59.760 the final two times you make anywhere
01:47:01.400 between a 100 to a th extra money this
01:47:03.760 is a loser trade but I would be long
01:47:08.440 CDs so what am I buying I am buying
01:47:11.679 insurance I'm buying Insurance using
01:47:14.199 credit default swaps I'm buying what's
01:47:16.280 called protection that there is no
01:47:18.960 default event in 2025 I would like a
01:47:23.119 little bit of an insurance policy in
01:47:25.719 2025 so that the men and the women that
01:47:28.800 we have voted in have the chance to do
01:47:30.880 their work in peace I think that there
01:47:33.280 is a small chance of some volatility
01:47:36.880 next year I hope it doesn't happen I
01:47:38.719 hope that this trade loses money but if
01:47:41.239 it hits it will be the best performing
01:47:43.199 asset of 2025 and I just want to be
01:47:44.960 clear this is not something I think will
01:47:46.440 happen it's not something I want to
01:47:48.119 happen but I do think that if you look
01:47:50.400 back in terms of just the tonnage of
01:47:52.280 dollarars you can can make and the
01:47:53.760 massive risk asymmetry that it presents
01:47:55.679 to you when you look at the
01:47:56.840 concentration of the S&P when you look
01:47:58.800 at just the total gross amount of debt
01:48:00.440 that we have when you look at rate
01:48:02.360 spiking all of these things say having a
01:48:04.520 little Insurance may not be a bad thing
01:48:07.440 it has
01:48:08.520 hit Nick you can show the CDs
01:48:12.119 graph so this thing for every billion
01:48:14.960 dollars of risk you would have put on
01:48:16.599 every billion dollars that you put on
01:48:18.440 would have cost you about a million
01:48:20.199 dollar and that million dollars would
01:48:22.320 have made you about $7 million in about
01:48:24.280 three months did you put it on I'm not
01:48:26.679 going to comment on my my trades Jason
01:48:30.520 oh okay but weal we talked about it off
01:48:32.320 air already but if you did put it on
01:48:33.960 does that mean you're taking us all to
01:48:35.639 Italy this summer no what's happening
01:48:37.679 here are you getting a boat for us to
01:48:38.920 record from the Allin yacht no but there
01:48:41.119 may be some boats for sale if this trade
01:48:42.800 keeps going this way oh why is this
01:48:45.480 important the CDs actually represents
01:48:48.119 the structural risk in the United States
01:48:50.400 private economy in the corporate economy
01:48:52.880 so Nick if you just put it back on so
01:48:54.199 when you see these spreads blowing out
01:48:56.639 this is actually a very important
01:48:58.080 warning sign and this is actually a
01:49:00.080 thing that I think Scott understands
01:49:02.440 well Howard understands well I think
01:49:04.440 they'll translate this to the
01:49:07.000 president if I have an opportunity to
01:49:09.119 explain it I will but this is a really
01:49:11.400 important Market to pay attention to
01:49:13.199 this is what was the canary and the coal
01:49:16.360 mine for the great financial crisis this
01:49:20.199 was the stuff that showed us that there
01:49:21.719 was a big default event happening in the
01:49:24.560 mortgage side of the market but then
01:49:26.320 that spilled over to the broader economy
01:49:29.560 and so the Tariff picture and the
01:49:31.960 recession picture will get played out in
01:49:34.040 this chart and I think it's something
01:49:35.480 that folks can and should probably pay
01:49:38.679 tremendous attention to because I think
01:49:40.560 now that this trade is in the money the
01:49:43.320 question is I don't think we want this
01:49:44.920 to happen that one Sigma two Sigma event
01:49:48.040 where all of a sudden this trade returns
01:49:49.679 a
01:49:50.360 THX is really bad well you know let's
01:49:53.320 keep our eye on the markets and uh as of
01:49:56.199 the taping here we're down about 5%

01:50:45.880 master of the fcking segue I have never

01:51:02.400 million in revenue for daily wire is
01:51:04.440 that true n figures actually last year
01:51:07.000 was 2 220 oh my God 220 what's going on
01:51:10.280 I saw some headline you're going
01:51:11.400 bankrupt how you going bankrupt with 220
01:51:13.560 we're not going bankrupt yeah not going
01:51:15.639 some restructuring actually Ben now that
01:51:17.639 you saw what's happening with Newsmax I
01:51:19.360 mean any thoughts to maybe brazing some
01:51:22.199 capital
01:51:23.440 yeah I mean it has it has let's just put
01:51:25.400 it has crossed our minds yes for sure
01:51:28.079 you're making 50 times the revenue of
01:51:30.400 Truth social congratulations but
01:51:33.679 actually what do you think when you see
01:51:35.280 the this Newsmax thing trade like this I
01:51:37.040 mean it's incredible yeah what is it
01:51:39.119 saying do you think I mean I I think
01:51:40.599 it's saying a couple of things I mean
01:51:41.880 one it's saying obviously look I I think
01:51:43.599 the PE ratios on on the Newsmax trade
01:51:45.560 are are you know ridiculous in in the
01:51:48.159 sense that it's going to revert back to
01:51:49.599 something closer to normaly I think that
01:51:51.639 the it was supposed to trade at 10 bucks
01:51:53.719 and it came out at 14 it spoke to like
01:51:55.639 240 so it's more like GameStop than
01:51:57.560 anything else there a lot of retail
01:51:59.280 traders who are fans of Newsmax who
01:52:00.840 bought the stock and then it leapt and I
01:52:02.440 think it was today back down in the 40s
01:52:04.320 something like that it'll end up being
01:52:06.000 you know total market cap will probably
01:52:07.639 be somewhere when it when it lands in
01:52:09.560 like the two to three Bill range
01:52:11.719 somewhere three to four Bill something
01:52:13.599 like that um I I think what it says is
01:52:16.000 that you know the the stock market in in
01:52:18.400 the short term is a voting machine and
01:52:19.719 in the long term it is a weighing
01:52:20.719 machine and I think that uh you know
01:52:22.880 when when you when you look at at stocks
01:52:24.679 that have name brand recognition uh then
01:52:27.119 you're going to get a lot of voting in
01:52:28.360 the early going and then it's a question
01:52:29.840 of whether you can keep that up so it
01:52:30.719 turns into weighing right fair enough 39
01:52:33.239 million in uh quarterly Revenue so
01:52:35.560 they're at1 150 $160 million a year and
01:52:39.480 their valuation right now I don't have
01:52:42.199 the market cap here but what did it Peak
01:52:43.639 out at 304 billion or something oh no
01:52:46.000 when it when it peaked it Peak above 20
01:52:47.400 bill yeah the market cap went to 170
01:52:50.840 bucks or 200 bucks 240 bucks 245s
01:52:53.520 yesterday yeah or two days ago you know
01:52:56.199 G something weird going on there okay uh

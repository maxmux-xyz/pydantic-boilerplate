00:03:24.799 you're having a productive week as one
00:03:26.440 of my management team members told me
00:03:28.599 today it's a very complex business
00:03:30.560 that's usually not a good sign when the
00:03:32.319 conversation starts with that is that a
00:03:34.720 way of saying everything's no no we we
00:03:37.360 we were good I was on the road this week
00:03:38.959 I just got back I mean it's hard running
00:03:41.040 a business is hard you hire the smartest
00:03:43.319 people you know and what happens they
00:03:45.959 bring you all the problems they can't
00:03:47.280 solve so it's it's never easy we've got
00:03:49.519 an incredible docket today let's just
00:03:52.799 start with I'll give you a quick recap
00:03:55.720 boys of the week since we last taped to
00:03:59.239 say the uh Zone was flooded in the words
00:04:02.599 of Steve Bannon would be an
00:04:03.959 understatement here's your Trump tsunami
00:04:06.840 for the week Thursday when we tape the
00:04:09.159 Epstein file dump Fiasco you remember
00:04:11.280 that Joe right big zero big nothing
00:04:13.480 burger then
00:04:15.239 Friday zalinski was dressed down and
00:04:17.918 kicked out of the White House by the
00:04:20.199 Vice President presidents markets
00:04:21.759 collapsed they rebounded on Saturday we
00:04:24.479 got a beautiful day off video of trump
00:04:27.000 dancing down a catwalk to YMCA maybe he
00:04:29.479 played played some golf he was at the
00:04:30.880 White House South Mar Lago Sunday 9:24
00:04:34.600 a.m. eastern the president pumps three
00:04:37.160 specific crypto salana Cardona xrp to be
00:04:40.479 in the first government strategic crypto
00:04:43.120 Reserve Joe ondale starts tweeting I
00:04:44.840 start tweeting everybody's tweeting he
00:04:46.680 quickly retweeted himself included
00:04:48.400 ethereum and Bitcoin some decentralized
00:04:50.720 coins reaction was wow crazy you had a
00:04:54.039 little bit of a spicy take Joe we'll get
00:04:55.960 into that later and I'm sure our friend
00:04:58.000 David saaks will have much to say in
00:04:59.800 second half of the program but it was
00:05:02.000 pretty negative Cardona ripped 70% xrp
00:05:05.280 32% salana 25% and then there was this
00:05:08.759 crazy trade one whale went 50 times long
00:05:11.400 on BTC and eth $200 million position on
00:05:14.440 just a $4 million investment everybody
00:05:16.919 trying to figure out who that was I'll
00:05:18.440 leave it to you to speculate then we
00:05:20.039 start the week Monday Trump says
00:05:22.800 significant TR tariffs with Canada and
00:05:25.120 Mexico the market collaps he walks back
00:05:27.120 tariffs couple of hours later and the
00:05:29.120 market starts to rebound then at 2:38
00:05:31.720 p.m. Trump announces a hundred billion
00:05:35.160 investment from tsmc in American Fabs
00:05:39.039 huz off for that and our boy David saaks
00:05:41.759 Gets dragged out to the podium for a
00:05:43.560 quick 15-second Cameo very nicely done
00:05:46.199 to our boy David saxs and then Tuesday
00:05:49.199 we have the most chaotic State of the
00:05:50.560 Union I've ever seen highlights include
00:05:52.600 an angry man shaking a cane and getting
00:05:54.680 kicked out there were some auction
00:05:56.639 paddles from the libs I don't know what
00:05:58.680 they were bidding on there were 13 Biden
00:06:00.520 mentions and one Pocahontas
00:06:03.639 Wednesday we have news that the Doge
00:06:05.919 Blitz might slow down Supreme Court
00:06:08.080 chimed in with a 54 decision backing the
00:06:10.639 federal judge who ordered the Trump
00:06:12.160 admin to pay out two billion for USA
00:06:14.000 contractors then there was a closo
00:06:15.840 meeting with the Senate with Elon maybe
00:06:17.560 they discussed an approval process maybe
00:06:19.440 some voting type things and then here we
00:06:22.120 are today Thursday when we're taping
00:06:24.240 Market's down 2% on more tariff news
00:06:27.199 breaking news drops at 11:30 Trump
00:06:29.120 announced are off for Mexico markets
00:06:31.599 aren't rebounding we might be leaving
00:06:34.039 NATO hold on almost almost there yeah
00:06:36.680 breaking we might be leaving NATO
00:06:39.120 breaking we're shutting down the
00:06:40.560 Department of Education psych we just
00:06:42.319 found out we're not okay gentlemen
00:06:44.520 that's the week that was no there's
00:06:46.440 there's three things that are also kind
00:06:48.120 of interwoven in all of
00:06:50.560 this open AI
00:06:52.960 dropped GPT 45 and I think it was not
00:06:57.120 really that well received I didn't even
00:06:59.280 know nobody's talking about that quen
00:07:01.599 which is the open source Alibaba dropped
00:07:03.840 to rev which seems actually really best
00:07:07.479 in class so that was really interesting
00:07:10.440 okay then there was a story that said
00:07:12.960 llama is going sideways Facebook's open
00:07:16.160 source llm yeah and then the markets
00:07:18.919 have just been going I think the
00:07:21.199 craziest I've actually seen in 20 years
00:07:24.039 of following the markets and
00:07:25.599 specifically you're seeing the mag 7
00:07:29.039 compressed towards the rest of the S&P
00:07:31.360 500 and then you're seeing this insane
00:07:34.879 trade away from Europe so there's a ton
00:07:37.720 that happened this week I mean I don't
00:07:40.280 remember a more eventful week Joe is
00:07:43.479 this a little too much maybe you guys
00:07:45.759 missed the Shalom Hamas tweet by Trump
00:07:48.000 too which for a lot of us is a big deal
00:07:49.759 he said I don't know if this is hello or
00:07:51.280 goodbye but he's threatening them really
00:07:53.680 strongly so for people who care about
00:07:55.199 that part of the world it's interesting
00:07:56.560 to watch what's going to happen so that
00:07:58.199 also happened yeah oh my lord well and
00:08:00.560 Shalom is hello and goodbye right just
00:08:02.680 to clarify as a word you would say it
00:08:05.159 both right Shalom yeah and peace
00:08:08.680 ambiguous word and
00:08:11.639 peace well maybe he's leaving it into
00:08:13.919 interpretation maybe they get to pick
00:08:16.000 maybe it's hello no that's what that's
00:08:18.080 what he wrote in the Tweet oh he did
00:08:20.919 yeah it's your choice okay it's should
00:08:22.400 Choose Your Own Adventure Hamas from the
00:08:24.759 president United States but I think we
00:08:27.680 should probably get into tariffs
00:08:30.039 this is confounding to most people maybe
00:08:34.958 since I just did the whole rundown I
00:08:36.360 won't go into all the details about tffs
00:08:38.839 again but just looking at it from first
00:08:42.240 principles Joe I asked a couple of group
00:08:44.680 chats you're in one one of them in
00:08:47.000 fact and I have about I say about 400
00:08:49.800 people total in these four group chats
00:08:51.360 what's the strategy here what do you
00:08:52.760 think Trump is trying to accomplish and
00:08:54.680 man I got a range of answers let me ask
00:08:56.760 you what is Trump in your estimation
00:09:00.600 trying to accomplish with the tariffs on
00:09:02.720 the tariffs off the Tariff on the
00:09:04.600 tariffs offs as Shou said here this is
00:09:06.839 creating more chaos than any of us have
00:09:08.600 ever seen in the markets listen Trump's
00:09:10.519 negotiating right so I I actually ran
00:09:12.120 into David saaks each Senator gets one
00:09:13.959 guest we are both guests in the Senate
00:09:15.320 dining hall hanging out with a bunch of
00:09:16.920 these guys multiple of the guests some
00:09:19.560 of them were spouses of the Senators
00:09:20.800 multiple of the guests were people who'
00:09:22.000 lost kids def fentanyl right and so this
00:09:24.720 actually is a very serious issue it's a
00:09:26.360 big thing on the populist right as it
00:09:28.160 should be for all Americans we've lost
00:09:29.839 you know tens of thousands of young
00:09:31.440 people recently to Fentanyl and and and
00:09:33.880 Canada has done nothing about their
00:09:35.800 border and so you know you just reported
00:09:37.760 breaking news I had even heard yet that
00:09:39.200 Mexico might be off can is still on he's
00:09:42.040 using this to negotiate so I talk to the
00:09:43.720 Senators and I asked him what's going on
00:09:45.160 because obviously I import things all
00:09:46.519 over the place I'd like to know what the
00:09:47.560 hell the rules are but he wants people
00:09:49.880 to actually crack down on this stuff and
00:09:52.040 save American lives and I think it's a
00:09:53.600 reasonable thing to use to negotiate and
00:09:55.160 force them to do that okay so you
00:09:57.399 believe it's negotiation because of the
00:10:00.200 fental issue Cham let me go to you
00:10:02.760 because many people are saying this has
00:10:04.560 more to do with some great reset and
00:10:08.079 maybe the tenure do you think this is
00:10:10.279 about fentol at the border or something
00:10:14.160 else I think that this is the first week
00:10:19.320 where I've seen the first real
00:10:23.279 Schism in how people are interpreting
00:10:26.519 what's actually happening I think that
00:10:29.480 Trump and Elon were very much in a
00:10:31.320 honeymoon period until this week and I
00:10:34.079 think there was the benefit of the doubt
00:10:36.600 but what I saw on X was a real
00:10:39.320 Divergence where on the one hand there
00:10:42.360 were people that were basically
00:10:44.279 saying doge is deranged Elon is crazy
00:10:48.440 Trump is lighting the world on fire in
00:10:50.240 one camp and the other Camp saying he's
00:10:52.920 sticking to the plan and when I thought
00:10:57.760 about this a little bit if you went back
00:11:00.079 to November the
00:11:02.120 5th I do think it's important to
00:11:04.399 remember that we were at this moment
00:11:06.279 where you had this fork in the
00:11:08.519 road and you had all these important
00:11:11.200 issues where I think the best way to
00:11:13.399 generalize it was that the Democrats
00:11:16.079 believed that the lines should continue
00:11:19.240 to be blurred so whether that was on
00:11:22.079 gender or race or Merit versus some
00:11:26.000 other immutable trait or fiscal and M
00:11:29.320 monetary policy things were just getting
00:11:31.480 more and more
00:11:33.639 blurred and then Trump and Elon
00:11:35.839 basically showed up and said actually we
00:11:38.200 want to refocus and we want to make the
00:11:40.959 lines very visible and clear on all
00:11:43.720 those Dimensions h and a majority of
00:11:46.399 Americans voted that
00:11:48.040 in but I think what you're starting to
00:11:50.519 see now is the difficulty in actually
00:11:54.839 implementing that
00:11:56.560 plan and what I mean specifically is
00:12:00.200 tariffs are very nuanced and complicated
00:12:03.200 on the one hand there's these short-term
00:12:05.040 wins there's these impacts you could
00:12:08.639 deem them positive or negative to the
00:12:10.279 dollar there's impacts to us bonds
00:12:13.600 there's impacts to us Bond markets
00:12:15.959 there's impacts to how countries deal
00:12:18.240 with foreign reserves and then there's
00:12:20.199 this impact that happens when the
00:12:21.639 markets react to a
00:12:23.680 tariff and then Trump takes that off the
00:12:26.240 table and then they snap back so you
00:12:29.440 have this weird set of boundary
00:12:32.680 conditions right now so I think right
00:12:34.040 now we're in the very difficult part of
00:12:36.360 sorting through what the long-term
00:12:39.040 implications are and I can get to some
00:12:40.639 of them later but I think that's where
00:12:42.240 we are I think that's really interesting
00:12:43.800 the goal of tariffs in your mind for
00:12:45.920 Trump is
00:12:48.360 fenol finance related no give me your
00:12:51.800 definitive what you think this is about
00:12:53.480 I think what tariffs allow us to do is
00:12:57.199 rebase
00:13:00.000 the long-term Reliance on the US dollar
00:13:03.720 it allows us to
00:13:06.600 rebase our ability to fund our own
00:13:10.399 deficits and it allows us to
00:13:13.120 rebase the long-term ability for
00:13:16.399 American companies to be economically
00:13:19.600 vibrant okay so freeberg we got one
00:13:23.839 person with fent all the Border
00:13:25.639 negotiating we got one person on trade
00:13:29.360 some portion of this I hear and I when I
00:13:31.240 asked in these four group chats I got
00:13:33.079 he's throwing stuff at the wall the
00:13:35.360 Border he's trolling the 10year note and
00:13:39.519 he doesn't care about stocks and then I
00:13:41.199 got onshoring and Manufacturing as a
00:13:44.720 possibility we're going to make it more
00:13:46.199 expensive to bring things in so why
00:13:47.839 don't you consider making stuff here do
00:13:49.839 you think that third possibility is
00:13:51.519 what's going on here just David freeberg
00:13:54.320 pick one of these three choices or
00:13:55.839 another what's going on here with tus
00:13:57.639 specifically I don't sit inside of
00:13:59.560 Trump's head and I don't have any direct
00:14:01.519 line of communication to folks that are
00:14:03.720 constructing the theory and the policy
00:14:06.480 if I were to say what's the most
00:14:08.680 masterful plan in an optimistic way of
00:14:11.759 what could be going on here what's the
00:14:13.399 master plan I would kind of craft it as
00:14:16.880 follows tariffs aren't being done in
00:14:19.120 isolation they're being done along with
00:14:21.360 a coordinated policy effort to reduce
00:14:24.800 income taxes and another policy effort
00:14:28.000 to reduce government spend
00:14:29.720 so those are three actions three legs on
00:14:32.000 a stool so tariffs M reduced income
00:14:36.120 taxes reduced government spending and
00:14:38.720 they are related to each other they're
00:14:40.519 related to each other because if we
00:14:42.320 increase tariffs one element of that is
00:14:45.440 that to import products is more
00:14:47.360 expensive for example I buy LED lights
00:14:50.240 in my
00:14:51.000 greenhouse and the price of the LED
00:14:53.120 lights just went up by 25% this week I
00:14:55.560 actually spoke with the CEO of an LED
00:14:57.240 company and I was like why don't you
00:14:58.360 guys make the LED here and there starts
00:15:00.920 to become a crossover point where it
00:15:03.480 actually makes economic sense for the
00:15:05.160 company to make the LEDs here instead of
00:15:07.079 sourcing them from Asia and there's a
00:15:09.279 100,000 examples of this when the
00:15:11.480 industrial supply chain goes to the
00:15:13.399 lowest part of
00:15:15.000 production it's going to end up
00:15:16.800 offshoring when there's no tariffs and
00:15:18.880 if there are tariffs then you start to
00:15:20.320 do production here so you're increasing
00:15:22.560 both kind of security for the US supply
00:15:25.399 chain but also increasing demand and
00:15:28.560 creation of a
00:15:30.399 Workforce Now I think that the income
00:15:33.040 tax piece is critical here because in
00:15:35.240 order to make the capital available to
00:15:37.720 build that industry here we need to have
00:15:39.600 unleash capital and reducing of income
00:15:42.120 taxes the economic theory would be that
00:15:44.720 Capital will now flow into these
00:15:46.480 entrepreneurial activity these
00:15:47.920 opportunities that have emerged where
00:15:49.639 suddenly it makes sense for me to make
00:15:51.120 textiles to make metals to make
00:15:53.279 materials to make cars to make all this
00:15:55.240 stuff here in the United States that I
00:15:56.440 otherwise wouldn't be making so both the
00:15:58.040 corporate and the personal income tax by
00:15:59.800 reducing it unleashes capital that
00:16:01.319 instead of going into the government it
00:16:03.040 now goes into the private sector into
00:16:04.680 building businesses okay I think that
00:16:06.959 there's another theory about this which
00:16:08.319 is as you drop the income
00:16:10.360 tax one of the kind of key theories that
00:16:12.639 I've heard spoken about a lot lately and
00:16:14.639 I think we're going to hear about it a
00:16:15.880 lot more this year is trying to get the
00:16:18.160 United States to move away from an
00:16:19.880 income taxation model to a consumption
00:16:21.839 taxation model so effectively what the
00:16:24.040 tariffs do is there's a tax for you
00:16:25.720 buying certain things so now instead of
00:16:28.199 getting taxed when when you earn money
00:16:30.040 as an individual you get taxed when you
00:16:32.399 spend money and some people think that
00:16:34.720 that's both a more fair system and a
00:16:36.880 more kind of economically vibrant system
00:16:38.800 because that will drive investment in
00:16:41.240 the things that people want to to
00:16:43.079 produce because the money's going into
00:16:44.560 production so you that do you think that
00:16:47.079 free Breg I'm curious I I don't know
00:16:49.000 it's a really interesting economic
00:16:50.480 theory I mean I am not opposed to seeing
00:16:53.839 some sort of an experiment play out
00:16:56.240 where we look at a shift from income
00:16:57.839 taxation to consumption Taxation and see
00:17:00.480 if it actually does have an effect on
00:17:02.319 economic growth and productivity it has
00:17:04.039 not been done in 150 years there's a lot
00:17:06.160 of economic theorists on both sides of
00:17:08.160 the equation saying this does work or it
00:17:10.319 doesn't work okay and let me just say
00:17:12.000 one last thing by reducing government
00:17:14.400 spending we are moving workers from the
00:17:17.839 government into the private Workforce so
00:17:19.919 as those new Industries pop up as those
00:17:21.760 Investments start to get made in
00:17:23.359 building new industry onshore where are
00:17:25.400 the workers going to come from remember
00:17:26.799 the government's 30% of the US GDP today
00:17:29.840 so if that's not a great way to invest
00:17:31.760 money maybe the Private Industry is
00:17:33.120 better at investing money in employing
00:17:34.679 people that will unleash the workforce
00:17:36.520 and it will counterbalance the inflation
00:17:39.160 that we're experiencing so there's a lot
00:17:40.559 of inflation because of tariffs and by
00:17:42.640 reducing government spending that's the
00:17:44.160 offset to inflation so those three
00:17:46.000 actions I think are three legs of a
00:17:47.400 stool and they actually are all
00:17:49.080 interrelated to one another so that
00:17:50.559 would be my grandmas theory of what
00:17:52.280 might be going on this is an interesting
00:17:53.799 triangulation theory that people have
00:17:55.360 been speculating about and there are a
00:17:58.080 couple of caveo here Joe number one we
00:18:00.280 do have lowering income tax and lowering
00:18:03.240 Services experiment it's called Florida
00:18:06.080 Texas and a couple of the states where
00:18:07.720 they have lower income tax and and more
00:18:09.679 consumption tax we pay a lot more in
00:18:12.400 real estate taxes here something we
00:18:13.960 consume putting that aside the really
00:18:16.919 interesting issue is we're at the lowest
00:18:18.520 unemployment of our lifetime 4% where
00:18:22.120 are all these workers going to come from
00:18:23.720 what do you think Joe now that you've
00:18:25.039 heard the two other panelists here
00:18:27.039 discuss it
00:18:29.080 what are we trying to get to where is
00:18:32.200 the destination at the end of this term
00:18:35.600 Trump's lame duck he can go wild here
00:18:37.880 he's not running for election and you
00:18:39.720 know what what do you think he wants to
00:18:41.640 see do you think he just wants
00:18:43.679 to sement some sort of legacy and if so
00:18:46.520 what's that Legacy and how do these
00:18:48.799 actions equal his goals and Legacy no
00:18:52.360 listen I agree with what David with what
00:18:54.159 David was saying Jason and it's it's a
00:18:56.039 really important point also that we
00:18:57.280 should mention is that the last four
00:18:59.000 years the economy's looked okay but part
00:19:00.840 of that is because government's been
00:19:02.039 hiring like mad and so the point he made
00:19:04.200 is that actually you know having twice
00:19:06.480 as many people you know harassing me I
00:19:08.840 just got back yesterday no action on an
00:19:10.520 audit that been harassing me on for
00:19:11.760 three years they found nothing having
00:19:13.600 twice as many people doing things like
00:19:15.000 that and and or like you know running
00:19:16.440 TSA or pushing papers around in the
00:19:18.120 Department of Labor doesn't actually add
00:19:20.880 output to the economy and so you know it
00:19:23.039 it does seem like it makes a lot of
00:19:24.240 sense let's take a million workers out
00:19:26.840 of the Consulting class around e DC out
00:19:29.240 of the you know paper pusher classro on
00:19:30.600 DC and let's actually deploy them to the
00:19:33.000 actual productive economy Elon and Trump
00:19:34.600 have both been saying that I think David
00:19:36.200 is 100% right and it is true a lot of my
00:19:37.880 companies thinks that the Tariff stuff
00:19:39.880 are looking to build stuff here so I'm
00:19:41.960 not a huge fan of tariffs personally but
00:19:44.440 they definitely make sense for things in
00:19:45.679 defense they definitely make sense for
00:19:46.960 negotiating with countries and it is
00:19:48.559 true it is pushing certain people to
00:19:50.679 including me to build some more things
00:19:51.880 in America here's where tariffs make a
00:19:53.760 lot of sense if you have markets where
00:19:56.200 there are domestic alternatives
00:19:58.840 Andor where things are fundamentally
00:20:01.000 commodity there's no reason why tariffs
00:20:03.440 can't work to create the incentives to
00:20:06.120 redomicile economic productivity inside
00:20:08.440 of the United States that's a that's a
00:20:10.320 slam dunk I think and and shamat there's
00:20:12.360 another Twist on that too which I think
00:20:13.520 we should all acknowledge is America
00:20:15.320 does have some really tough
00:20:16.320 environmental laws despite what Jason
00:20:18.520 may think of me I actually don't want my
00:20:20.000 daughters growing up with you messy air
00:20:21.960 messy water you know screwed up country
00:20:23.840 oh I don't think that of you I I know
00:20:25.440 that you're a nature guy you're like a
00:20:27.600 classic bush guy but but here's here's
00:20:30.000 the thing in China and Indonesia and all
00:20:31.840 these other countries they are just
00:20:33.440 shoting over the environment as they
00:20:34.880 make things I think tariffs are very
00:20:36.400 reasonable on that case like it's not
00:20:37.919 fair to make it more expensive for us
00:20:39.400 because we're doing it well and then we
00:20:40.880 Outsource it for them to destroy things
00:20:42.280 right so so there are some things there
00:20:43.720 where it does make sense and what I
00:20:45.320 would say is the other the other side of
00:20:47.520 the of the Tariff knife is that if there
00:20:50.520 are markets though where you're making
00:20:52.760 something that's fundamentally
00:20:54.039 Innovative where you are but one maker
00:20:57.760 the problematic part of where tariffs
00:21:00.679 really affect the US consumer is then
00:21:03.159 the price of that product of which there
00:21:05.360 are no competitive Alternatives can go
00:21:09.240 very very high and that's inflationary
00:21:11.960 and I think that that slows down
00:21:13.360 consumption and then if if that
00:21:14.840 consumption is not just of something
00:21:16.360 that's a nice to have but a must have
00:21:19.080 then it becomes problematic and so you
00:21:20.840 could see where tariffs could impact
00:21:23.919 certain
00:21:25.440 industries for example if there are
00:21:27.600 Innovative drugs I think that that's
00:21:29.200 problematic if there are Innovative
00:21:30.679 Technologies of which there's only one
00:21:32.360 vendor that's problematic so all of
00:21:34.240 those need to get sorted out but on
00:21:36.679 balance in commodity markets like look
00:21:38.840 at Autos Autos is a perfect example
00:21:41.480 there are so many purveyors and
00:21:44.880 providers of Autos there is oems all
00:21:47.799 around the world and so to have a
00:21:51.159 compensatory
00:21:52.960 system doesn't seem like an unreasonable
00:21:55.640 thing where it's a tit fortat tariff but
00:21:58.200 in markets where if you need for example
00:22:00.960 a specific piece of equipment from asml
00:22:04.080 to build a chip and now all of a sudden
00:22:06.799 that that machine is 25% more expensive
00:22:09.559 or 30% more expensive and they pass that
00:22:11.880 cost
00:22:12.919 Downstream it becomes very speculative
00:22:16.720 and it becomes a little bit more fragile
00:22:18.440 I think this is dangerous though right
00:22:19.960 jth because I agree with you in theory
00:22:22.240 but then there's something where you
00:22:23.840 know if everyone's lobbing for their
00:22:25.120 thing to be an exception you end up
00:22:26.520 getting this very crony system that's
00:22:28.200 that you don't necessarily want right so
00:22:30.080 you have to be very careful how you
00:22:31.279 define these things exactly so this is
00:22:33.279 why the I think like sector by sector
00:22:35.640 it's probably you can probably go and
00:22:37.960 pass the smell test and say if there are
00:22:40.200 multiple providers and or if it's
00:22:41.919 somehow
00:22:43.320 commodity I think it's easier to absorb
00:22:45.880 the Tariff in the short term maybe
00:22:47.159 that's the right way to say it which is
00:22:48.520 if you believe if Trump believes
00:22:50.679 everything should be tariffed then
00:22:52.840 instead of debating if to your point
00:22:55.120 maybe the right thing to debate is when
00:22:57.440 and you have to put things on a much
00:22:59.440 longer Glide path so that you don't just
00:23:02.720 create inflation out of nowhere and or
00:23:05.000 you don't hold back American business or
00:23:07.480 American consumers well this is a key
00:23:09.480 point because you do need to have
00:23:10.720 predictability to make investment and
00:23:13.120 reciprocity so really two important
00:23:14.840 points Shaman's making here one on
00:23:16.760 reciprocity these things haven't been
00:23:18.559 looked at for a while I'm not sure how
00:23:20.279 they got so out of whack but just
00:23:22.120 putting some facts to this uh chat's
00:23:24.520 exactly correct we get placed uh when we
00:23:27.360 send cars to the EU they they get a 10%
00:23:29.880 tariff but when we get their cars it's a
00:23:32.240 2 and a half% tariff who let it get out
00:23:34.360 of whack I'm not sure but why not make
00:23:36.840 the reciprocity perfect and just hey you
00:23:39.080 say 10 we say 10 you say two and a half
00:23:40.720 we say two and a half and that would
00:23:42.120 make I think a lot more sense just to
00:23:44.080 put some numbers here on government
00:23:46.640 employees it's not as bad as people make
00:23:50.200 it out to be a lot of our spending is
00:23:52.200 nonemployee related but it is if you
00:23:55.080 look over the last two administrations
00:23:56.520 we have added million 2 million three
00:23:58.960 employees across all I disagree and that
00:24:01.679 hold on let me just finish the sentence
00:24:02.760 so you have the facts and then you can
00:24:03.799 disagree with the facts one point3
00:24:06.919 million additional employees added this
00:24:09.679 does not include contractors and so we
00:24:11.799 don't know what USA was doing with Nos
00:24:14.039 and contractors and I think that's where
00:24:16.520 we do need to get some clarity and to
00:24:18.679 chat's point this has all got to become
00:24:20.919 predictable you cannot put tariffs on
00:24:23.520 off every week or else how does your
00:24:26.000 friend Dave who wants to do the LED
00:24:27.679 lighting or your encouraging to do LED
00:24:29.919 lighting know if they should build a
00:24:31.919 factory and invest 10 million in that
00:24:34.399 you disagree with the number of
00:24:35.840 employees you want to address that yeah
00:24:37.399 look the government accounts for 30% of
00:24:39.880 GDP in the United States that's an
00:24:41.960 extraordinary sum so just I was talking
00:24:44.159 just about the employees that's a much
00:24:45.919 smaller percentage but that doesn't
00:24:47.360 matter the direct employees of federal
00:24:49.640 agencies is a fraction of people that
00:24:52.200 are employed indirectly by government
00:24:54.000 spending this is super important as we
00:24:56.279 all know many government agencies write
00:24:59.080 checks to large contractors
00:25:01.320 subcontractors and third party service
00:25:03.440 providers that do the work for them so
00:25:05.559 the money gets transferred they then
00:25:07.240 employ the people and they do the work
00:25:08.640 so it doesn't technically show up on
00:25:10.000 federal government payroll registers but
00:25:12.559 these are people that are indirectly
00:25:14.520 employed by federal spending that's
00:25:16.360 super important to to acknowledge that a
00:25:18.240 large percentage of the US Workforce is
00:25:20.720 indirectly supported by federal dollars
00:25:24.039 yeah it's gone up it's gone up massively
00:25:25.720 with the NGS too so you've had about
00:25:27.120 four million people employed by
00:25:28.520 contractors in DC 1.6 million more at
00:25:30.919 the states actually by federal by
00:25:32.960 federal spending and then you have the
00:25:34.520 NOS no one knows the noos Biden
00:25:36.600 Administration took down the data I used
00:25:38.159 to see things in 2020 so we don't even
00:25:40.240 know how much money but we know it was
00:25:41.399 hundreds of billions so it's pretty
00:25:43.120 crazy the number one thing about how
00:25:44.840 doge is not being done fully is that
00:25:47.880 Elon is doing an amazing job you know
00:25:49.640 whether or not he cuts 500 billion or
00:25:51.120 trillion or a lot more but the Senators
00:25:53.760 and the congressmen are not willing to
00:25:55.679 take it out of their bill the
00:25:56.520 reconciliation bill right now talking
00:25:58.600 about cutting one to two trillion so
00:26:00.120 rather than like this is over 10 years
00:26:01.919 it's ridiculous it's ridiculous if it
00:26:04.200 was equal to Elon was doing it'd be at
00:26:05.520 least five trillion dollar and I've
00:26:07.039 pushed a bunch of them they say oh the
00:26:08.399 Congressional budget office and all
00:26:09.520 these things I'm sure there's some tough
00:26:11.279 things there but like this is crazy we
00:26:12.799 need to see what these Cuts need to be
00:26:14.279 on Doge and we need to cut five trillion
00:26:16.559 and none of these people have the balls
00:26:17.720 to do that is there's not the political
00:26:18.960 will to do it is my interpretation and
00:26:20.720 just no coones let me just show you one
00:26:23.279 chart to back that up I have my new disg
00:26:25.440 graciados
00:26:28.440 look at this chamama you want to talk
00:26:30.480 about software and waste
00:26:33.720 35,8 55 according to Doge breaking news
00:26:38.640 service now licenses on three products
00:26:41.480 only being used by 84 people oh my God
00:26:45.159 you kidding me
00:26:47.240 11,000 acrobat licenses with
00:26:50.720 0.0 users
00:26:53.919 disad absolutely abhorrent and I'm
00:26:57.919 saying it right now I want an
00:26:59.919 investigation into procurement who sold
00:27:02.240 this who bought it this could be a crime
00:27:05.080 this could be fraud that could be
00:27:06.200 Kickbacks I'm saying there could be I
00:27:07.919 don't think it's that but I do think you
00:27:09.840 have to look at the earnings of these
00:27:11.360 companies in question where's totally
00:27:13.720 correct number two totally correct if
00:27:16.440 service now ever wants to work with the
00:27:18.440 government again Mr
00:27:20.360 President Mr President our president I
00:27:24.120 want them to pay us back for the unused
00:27:27.679 licensees is and I want a full order for
00:27:29.679 the last 10 years if they don't pay us
00:27:31.799 back that money and give us a credit
00:27:33.360 hold on list banned forever hold on it's
00:27:35.240 not thank you Mr President this may not
00:27:37.000 be service now's fault this may be the
00:27:38.799 inaptitude of the people that bought the
00:27:40.360 LI course but they should still give us
00:27:41.600 a credit I want the money back for the
00:27:43.399 American people I do think Adobe has the
00:27:45.519 worst have you guys ever done Adobe
00:27:46.960 subscriptions they're impossible to
00:27:48.279 cancel I think Adobe 11,000 Z us only
00:27:51.760 the only thing harder than cancelling an
00:27:53.480 adobe license is trying to cancel Wall
00:27:55.240 Street Journal I was about to say Wall
00:27:57.000 Street Journal
00:27:59.440 Hall of Fame let me just say something
00:28:01.760 about the the budget because Joe brings
00:28:04.480 up something important unbelievable I'll
00:28:07.120 just say it again at the sake of being
00:28:08.799 redundant we're getting to the phase
00:28:10.519 where the details are complicated and
00:28:12.519 they now matter so we've talked about
00:28:15.320 repealing the IRA in its totality right
00:28:18.720 so that was a statement and there's
00:28:20.159 there's theoretically a lot of money
00:28:22.480 there but the details now all of a
00:28:24.840 sudden become
00:28:26.279 complicated FK published a report just
00:28:29.440 this past week and what do you think it
00:28:32.679 said was the percentage of incremental
00:28:36.559 electricity that was generated from
00:28:38.399 Renewables versus non-renewables I I'll
00:28:40.880 tell you the answer it was almost 91% in
00:28:43.640 December so if you now tie two huge
00:28:47.399 initiatives together which is how do we
00:28:49.559 find a budget that saves money and how
00:28:52.279 do we continue to win an AI maybe you
00:28:54.760 would have thought those weren't related
00:28:57.360 well guess what
00:28:58.600 we know that AI needs a tremendous
00:29:01.320 amount of power and whatever you thought
00:29:03.760 you knew actually you had to reer right
00:29:06.360 because what Elon has shown is actually
00:29:08.240 you need to now create these Mega
00:29:10.519 clusters 100,000 gpus going to a million
00:29:13.559 gpus all of the Power forecasting that
00:29:16.200 we have is miscast it doesn't even
00:29:18.519 account for this number one number two
00:29:21.399 there are 35,000
00:29:23.640 applications into
00:29:25.919 FK to get approved to generate
00:29:29.000 electricity 35,000 that's going to
00:29:31.159 meander through some administrative
00:29:33.919 rigu there is a 5year delay to get a gas
00:29:38.120 turbine into America and
00:29:40.320 online okay if you ordered one today the
00:29:43.480 fastest that you can get it turned on is
00:29:45.919 2030 the fastest that you can get a
00:29:48.080 nuclear turned on is
00:29:49.559 2035 so we don't have the ability to
00:29:52.480 generate incremental electricity very
00:29:54.480 quickly but for Renewables but then if
00:29:57.799 you rip out the IRA there's many parts
00:30:00.760 of the IRA by the way that are just
00:30:02.279 trash Nick I don't know if you can find
00:30:04.000 it but Barry Weiss found this insane
00:30:06.640 thing that made me so angry which I'm
00:30:08.799 happy to talk about which was like a
00:30:10.159 30-day Grant process that resulted in A7
00:30:13.320 billion Grant to some shell oh this was
00:30:15.440 throwing the gold bars off the castle
00:30:18.600 but but the other part of the IRA this
00:30:21.200 narrow part is what it did to reinforce
00:30:24.440 tax incentives and tax equity which is a
00:30:27.440 200 billion
00:30:28.480 Market that incentivizes that 90% of
00:30:31.519 energy generation so my point is that
00:30:34.480 when you start to get into the details
00:30:36.519 when the house Ways and Means Community
00:30:38.799 has to figure out what part to put back
00:30:41.919 this is going to be hard because it's
00:30:43.519 like hold on if you got the whole thing
00:30:46.039 now all of a sudden you take 90% of the
00:30:47.960 incremental energy generation incentives
00:30:49.720 out of the market you don't have enough
00:30:51.799 electrons there isn't enough electricity
00:30:54.279 so then you lose the AI Ray so you start
00:30:56.159 to lose it I think the point is that
00:30:58.399 we're now in the hard part where the
00:30:59.840 details really matter listen you got to
00:31:02.240 start with the chainsaw we saw that at
00:31:04.080 Twitter and by the way maybe you do like
00:31:07.080 when we started this he just tweeted
00:31:08.480 this out he said guys now it's time to
00:31:10.039 get surgical he and he said this per yes
00:31:12.120 that was the metaphor I was about to use
00:31:13.600 is like you know you start with you cut
00:31:15.320 out the goddamn service now in Adobe
00:31:17.919 subscriptions and then you work on
00:31:19.279 something you know more DEA and maybe
00:31:21.279 that's where we are IR just for the
00:31:23.760 audience inflation reduction can I just
00:31:25.720 do a rant on this on this pop-up NGO
00:31:28.840 thing to me this is like the worst of
00:31:30.559 America and it makes me so angry and
00:31:32.600 I'll tell you my lived experience so I'm
00:31:34.159 on the other side of this I started a
00:31:36.320 company with these guys from Tesla to
00:31:38.120 make battery materials in the United
00:31:40.320 States in
00:31:42.120 2019 we grind we grind we put in tens I
00:31:45.120 put in tens of millions of dollars we
00:31:47.360 get a deal with a big
00:31:49.120 OEM and then you see these doe grants we
00:31:52.960 spent millions of dollars we file a very
00:31:55.519 detailed plan to build battery medals
00:31:57.519 and battery capacity in
00:31:59.760 America we got rejected okay it was an
00:32:02.880 entire yearlong process we got rejected
00:32:05.960 we put it past us we kept working we
00:32:08.760 found more deals we found a way to
00:32:10.919 survive raise a little bit more money
00:32:13.360 and then we applied again on some
00:32:15.880 success and we got a $100 million Grant
00:32:19.519 okay that was that's what just happened
00:32:21.519 this year but then yesterday I read and
00:32:24.279 Nick maybe you can throw this tweet up
00:32:25.880 this Barry Weiss investigation
00:32:29.159 somebody in 30 days who was connected to
00:32:32.279 the Democratic infrastructure had some
00:32:34.919 shell organization that got a grant that
00:32:36.960 was 70 times bigger than us like we've
00:32:41.000 made stuff we have deals with
00:32:43.360 oems we had to validate every step of
00:32:45.919 the way we were rejected once so our
00:32:47.880 process to get a $100 million doe
00:32:50.440 program was two years these people
00:32:53.519 showed up in 30 days and got seven
00:32:55.919 billion that's just wrong why didn't you
00:32:59.200 put why didn't you lead with Dei or
00:33:01.080 something you would have gotten a
00:33:02.039 billion you just LED with the wrong
00:33:03.600 thing you were actually providing a
00:33:04.919 product or service people need this is
00:33:07.519 this this is why you don't have any
00:33:08.720 equity in there for the minerals this is
00:33:11.120 why it's so frustrating to build for the
00:33:12.559 government guys this is what paler and
00:33:13.960 SpaceX had to deal with that's why they
00:33:15.200 both sued the government is that all the
00:33:16.919 friends who used to be the CIO used to
00:33:18.600 be the general made the right donations
00:33:21.000 had the right kid on the board it's all
00:33:23.039 corrupt and then the actual substantive
00:33:24.840 people you have to work like how do they
00:33:26.559 give $7 billion in 30 days we're gonna
00:33:30.279 find out you got a bunch of democra
00:33:32.039 operatives on the board let well let me
00:33:33.519 challenge you guys on one point there
00:33:35.279 are now claims being made by reporters
00:33:38.120 and by Third parties that are saying it
00:33:40.240 is a new form of
00:33:41.880 kleptocracy with all the friends of
00:33:43.799 Silicon Valley installing their friends
00:33:46.799 and agency heads as under secretaries
00:33:49.519 and so on that's going to benefit
00:33:51.159 Silicon Valley investors Silicon Valley
00:33:53.240 companies Joe jamath Jal I mean how do
00:33:56.720 you guys react the claims that there's
00:33:59.039 now you know this new kind of
00:34:00.679 kleptocratic movement it's the old guard
00:34:02.399 is gone new guard you have paler you
00:34:05.600 have andreil so go ahead you you answer
00:34:07.600 let's let's talk about this I mean when
00:34:09.520 we go to DC when I go to DC what I am
00:34:11.639 asking is I want there to be a Fair
00:34:13.320 competition and if I win I want my
00:34:15.639 company to actually be able to win the
00:34:16.839 contract because the way it's worked for
00:34:18.520 20 years like like epis you just raised
00:34:20.520 $250 million this week it's a great
00:34:22.399 company we you know we had a big contest
00:34:24.560 four years ago L3 rathon northr these
00:34:27.239 guys you know in and out of government
00:34:28.800 for decades they've they've gotten tens
00:34:30.560 of billions of dollars to the same
00:34:31.760 technology area when we went
00:34:33.320 head-to-head with them we we didn't just
00:34:35.040 like beat them by a little bit we shot
00:34:36.280 down the hardened drones nine and a half
00:34:38.199 times farther away same size same power
00:34:40.000 nine and a half times completely wiped
00:34:41.320 the floor what was the cost difference
00:34:42.839 between the bids like are you saving us
00:34:44.800 massive money massive money I invested
00:34:46.760 only 30 40 in the whole thing at that
00:34:48.440 point and they spent billions and we
00:34:49.679 have much cheaper much better not even a
00:34:51.480 question and and you talk to the and you
00:34:53.599 talk to like at the time the the chief
00:34:55.399 of staff of the Air Force the guy run
00:34:56.839 the four star and and he says well Joe
00:34:58.960 this was written three years ago it
00:35:00.359 looks like rathon probably did help
00:35:01.800 write it and they required all these
00:35:03.359 things and your way you're doing it I'm
00:35:04.599 like I I'm like yeah I'm using a chip
00:35:06.000 instead of a cathod ray tube that's why
00:35:07.520 it's working so much better like yeah
00:35:08.560 but it was written for the way they're
00:35:09.560 doing it and I could overrule it but it
00:35:11.680 break a lot of glass so you probably
00:35:13.280 wouldn't get in three years because
00:35:14.280 everyone knows you're the best but it's
00:35:15.359 too it's too frust you know it's too
00:35:16.839 stressful to give it to you right now
00:35:18.079 like that is that so so so what I'm
00:35:19.880 doing is I'm not going and saying give
00:35:21.480 my company's money I'm saying I'm saying
00:35:23.720 make this actually a functional logical
00:35:25.680 process and give me a chance to win it
00:35:26.920 from the best and that that is a hundred
00:35:28.560 times better for our country to push how
00:35:30.440 do you but how do you make that
00:35:31.560 transparent and how do you avoid there
00:35:33.480 has to be massive transparency how do
00:35:35.000 you avoid the the perception of conflict
00:35:37.480 and the perception of kleptocracy well
00:35:39.480 it's acquisition it's acquisition reform
00:35:41.359 right so like this this a really
00:35:42.440 important story you guys probably know
00:35:43.880 we were in the Philippine jungles in the
00:35:45.200 early 1910s needed new pistols our
00:35:47.200 pistols were terrible they had like a
00:35:48.760 one-page thing what they needed there's
00:35:50.240 six arm manufacturers competed that's
00:35:52.119 how we got the Colt 1911 in like three
00:35:53.960 months it won by the by by a large
00:35:56.160 amount it's an awesome gun uh 12 years
00:35:59.000 ago we had a 700 something page document
00:36:01.760 that the bureaucrats spent years on
00:36:03.040 outling what they needed for a new
00:36:04.200 pistol or probably needed to do Dei
00:36:05.839 stuff I have no idea it's like this long
00:36:07.599 comical document they still don't have a
00:36:09.200 new pistol today and so the way the way
00:36:11.400 we do it is we have a very clear process
00:36:14.000 where it's very specific on the outcomes
00:36:16.079 not on the inputs and you have a contest
00:36:18.440 and and then and then you make sure that
00:36:20.160 you know it's not it's obvious who wins
00:36:21.760 guys it's not like we're like slightly
00:36:23.040 better it's like we're shaming them so
00:36:24.400 the only way they can stop us is by
00:36:26.119 playing these games so much
00:36:29.200 better I think that if you're in the
00:36:31.359 administration or if you join some part
00:36:35.280 of the administration whether you're a
00:36:37.520 full-time employee or a gsse or just a
00:36:40.800 volunteer there's going to be that
00:36:42.760 perception of impropriety or influence
00:36:44.920 pedaling that's comes with the territory
00:36:47.480 so how do you avoid it and I think that
00:36:50.280 Joe is exactly right when the
00:36:52.440 administration was getting formed one of
00:36:54.280 the things that happened I had an
00:36:55.480 opportunity to work with some of the
00:36:56.800 folks to write some proposals for what
00:36:59.520 theoretically could happen in some of
00:37:00.920 these bigger government organizations
00:37:02.599 where there's just huge pockets of spend
00:37:05.119 and where I spent most of my time is
00:37:06.839 what Joe talked about how do you create
00:37:09.560 Open Standards so that it's very clear
00:37:13.240 what the competition is so that the
00:37:15.160 rules on the ground can't get
00:37:17.359 manipulated by people who are rolling
00:37:19.480 out of government into private industry
00:37:22.040 or somebody has a very deep relationship
00:37:24.720 because of lobbying those are the things
00:37:26.800 that pervert the clarity of what should
00:37:28.720 happen because then what happens can be
00:37:30.960 far a field to that so number one is I
00:37:33.920 think knowing that this time around a
00:37:36.640 different class of people are going to
00:37:38.200 be seen on the quote unquote popular
00:37:41.079 side it's really critical that all of us
00:37:45.119 that are involved in this promote
00:37:47.640 extremely transparent Open Standards
00:37:50.200 publish every RFP publish every spec
00:37:53.560 publish every evaluation criteria make
00:37:56.400 these things as mean itic as possible so
00:37:58.760 for example if you're going to go and
00:38:01.319 field a drone there's an incredibly
00:38:04.280 detailed set of data that you should be
00:38:06.240 publishing in it's not dissimilar to how
00:38:08.280 an FAA asks for flight test data and you
00:38:11.160 should be able to review that so that
00:38:14.560 then it can be escalated so that if
00:38:16.119 somebody then gets a deal because of
00:38:17.800 preference and you think you're
00:38:19.520 structurally better on the data there
00:38:22.160 needs to be an escalation and a release
00:38:23.839 valve that says hold on this is just
00:38:25.240 being manipulated and I think that's you
00:38:27.800 fight back yeah on not just this version
00:38:30.440 of a potential Winning Side versus
00:38:32.520 losing side but forever in the future
00:38:34.920 the government should be open the
00:38:37.440 government should be transparent and
00:38:39.880 every single point at which they're
00:38:41.440 making a decision and giving money
00:38:43.240 should be measurable and known you guys
00:38:45.119 got exactly right there's
00:38:47.200 transparency there's oversight obviously
00:38:50.000 but there's whistleblowers as well and
00:38:52.200 there's the role of the press in all of
00:38:53.880 this to sort of fact check it and to
00:38:56.079 check in on it as a safeguard with the
00:38:59.200 public getting engaged and that's one of
00:39:00.839 the great things that Doge has done by
00:39:03.040 having a Twitter handle I can pull up
00:39:05.240 hey here's what's going on with these
00:39:06.440 licenses and make an example so that
00:39:09.119 kind of transparency helps and then
00:39:10.560 finally we have to look at campaign
00:39:13.079 finance that is where a lot of the
00:39:15.599 appearance of proprietary exists go back
00:39:18.160 to this other thing because that's a
00:39:19.200 super important Point like it just
00:39:20.960 occurred to me that if what you said
00:39:22.680 happens then look the incentive today in
00:39:25.480 America is to try to position oneself to
00:39:28.520 have one of these
00:39:29.880 roles and the reason is because David of
00:39:32.359 what you said there is the chance to
00:39:34.200 then preferentially nudge an opportunity
00:39:37.880 your way right yes why do people sit on
00:39:41.240 committees why do people
00:39:43.880 volunteer at least at that level and if
00:39:47.359 you introduce Open Standards then the
00:39:50.359 real incentive to want to go do this
00:39:52.200 should be because you actually are
00:39:53.480 patriotic and want to just help so chth
00:39:55.720 I think I think you're right about the
00:39:56.680 standards but I want push back on the
00:39:58.200 incentive today like I know a lot of the
00:40:00.040 people who are getting into this and I
00:40:02.319 really do think they're there to fight
00:40:03.960 for the country I don't just say this
00:40:05.680 like as like you know naively or
00:40:07.480 something like these people really are
00:40:08.640 there for the right reasons for the most
00:40:09.920 part no I know I'm just saying generally
00:40:11.839 over like the last 50 years if you look
00:40:13.599 at people there is this implied sense
00:40:15.599 like for example like Goldman Sachs had
00:40:17.520 a direct line to become treasury
00:40:19.079 secretary if you were the CEO of Goldman
00:40:21.079 You' you were the treasury secretary now
00:40:24.119 don't you think that that was discussed
00:40:25.520 amongst Partners at Goldman and and do
00:40:27.760 we not think on the margins that that
00:40:29.200 beneficially helped Goldman of course it
00:40:31.160 did we'd be we'd be naive to think
00:40:32.880 otherwise my my point is not that my
00:40:35.200 point is just that going forward the
00:40:36.680 best thing all of our friends could do
00:40:39.200 is just make it all open source and Open
00:40:41.680 Standards that would be an incredible
00:40:43.640 artifact I think for America Joe I think
00:40:45.760 you telling us hey I trust these people
00:40:47.440 they're our friends you know that works
00:40:49.079 with all of us because yes we know them
00:40:50.680 we know they're going to do the standup
00:40:52.119 right thing and if you already have a
00:40:53.839 ton of money like some incremental
00:40:55.240 amount of money is not going to move the
00:40:56.560 needle for you it's it's farsal for us
00:40:58.680 to think that David Sachs is going to
00:41:00.240 give up four years of income producing
00:41:02.960 have to sell all his positions and that
00:41:05.000 is in some way good for his balance
00:41:06.640 sheet it is not he's going to miss out
00:41:08.440 on four years of AI and the massive
00:41:11.160 runup of our lifetime in order to serve
00:41:13.280 the country but I can tell you people
00:41:15.160 don't believe that just like you know
00:41:17.160 you talked about the kleptocracy and the
00:41:19.880 revolving door to raon or whoever that
00:41:22.960 people have talked about forever what
00:41:24.400 you need is whistleblower protections
00:41:27.319 journalists going after this like Barry
00:41:29.680 Weiss is doing old school journalism
00:41:32.760 investigative The Whistleblower laws are
00:41:35.359 great in our country we need to keep
00:41:36.839 reinforcing those but I'm going to go
00:41:38.599 back to we need to limit campaign
00:41:41.200 contributions we have to get rid of
00:41:42.839 super packs because these create the
00:41:44.839 appearance of impropriety and the
00:41:46.280 appearance of impropriety with Trump's
00:41:47.920 mean coin and that announcement on
00:41:49.920 Sunday for the crypto Reserve was you
00:41:52.800 know it doesn't help the mission here
00:41:55.599 that Trump is trying to get done so so
00:41:57.240 maybe you could speak to that because
00:41:58.680 that's where the appearance of
00:41:59.599 impropriety is great you got people like
00:42:01.400 Sor who's doing his Bitcoin thing he's
00:42:04.119 going on Friday and you know sax will do
00:42:07.560 a do a little bit here and announce some
00:42:09.480 stuff on the program hopefully but maybe
00:42:12.160 you could talk about what you objected
00:42:14.000 to with the coins the meme coin Endor
00:42:18.760 the the announcement of the crypto
00:42:20.839 Reserve should our government and after
00:42:23.400 all this donations from massive people
00:42:26.240 like I saw at the crypto ball all the
00:42:28.200 people who were tweeted by Trump that
00:42:29.880 looks terrible you tell me what you
00:42:32.119 think I agree with you on the Tweet
00:42:33.800 you're sneaking two things together here
00:42:35.040 though so I want to be really precise
00:42:36.280 Jason because let's be precise that's
00:42:37.800 what we do here there are a lot of
00:42:39.760 different possible ways that people can
00:42:42.359 help politicians and so one of them is
00:42:44.359 if you're a celebrity like even all your
00:42:46.640 guys show at this point you can you can
00:42:48.280 affect what people think that's powerful
00:42:50.440 more there's there's other ways that if
00:42:52.480 you're part of a big Union if you're
00:42:54.079 part of a government Union that's very
00:42:55.680 powerful you know in our society if
00:42:58.079 you're part of the American Medical
00:42:59.760 Association Healthcare System that the
00:43:01.280 doctors and health systems are very
00:43:02.559 powerful even without super packs in our
00:43:04.160 society and what a Super PAC is it's a
00:43:06.280 former free speech and it's true wealthy
00:43:08.520 people have the ability to influence
00:43:10.480 things through that speech but it's like
00:43:12.440 one of many and so if you're cutting
00:43:14.000 that you're basically saying okay I
00:43:15.040 don't want Elon and Joe to have as much
00:43:17.400 say there but I do want to have even
00:43:19.079 more say for the celebrities and for the
00:43:21.040 doctors and for the union members and
00:43:22.599 government so you have to realize you're
00:43:23.880 dealing with a complicated situation
00:43:25.240 with lots of forms of power I do agree
00:43:27.280 with you as I said listen I saw David
00:43:29.160 and gave each other a hug I think we're
00:43:30.640 all good but I was very frustrated with
00:43:33.079 the posts of trump mentioning specific
00:43:35.079 coins I don't know who was trading them
00:43:36.760 before it just looks bad like we're
00:43:38.359 fighting all this grift doing all these
00:43:39.960 things where we have the moral High
00:43:40.960 Ground I agree I don't want to give up
00:43:42.559 the moral High ground with these with
00:43:43.640 these silly schemes that that that's
00:43:45.040 100% the case are you saying with like
00:43:47.319 there's many forms of influence that you
00:43:48.960 think Super packs and rich people should
00:43:50.839 be able to I think speech is important
00:43:52.920 $50 million $2 million donations you
00:43:55.359 actually think that's fair for democracy
00:43:57.240 I actually I actually think speech is
00:43:59.079 very important I think the ability for
00:44:00.520 me to send out something is say guys I'm
00:44:02.480 studying this it's corrupt it's been
00:44:04.079 corrupt for 50 years we have to all get
00:44:06.040 together and stand against these Health
00:44:07.480 Systems these crazy defense companies
00:44:09.319 that have captured and broken everything
00:44:10.720 like I I think my ability to speak and
00:44:12.440 do that and to convince people is really
00:44:14.359 valuable and I and I've you know I
00:44:15.520 passed dozens of laws each year into
00:44:17.240 these different states by convincing
00:44:18.480 people nothing to do with making me
00:44:20.240 money that these incentives and
00:44:21.680 accountability are wrong I think that's
00:44:23.640 a good thing that I'm allowed to do that
00:44:25.119 should be so when you say speech you
00:44:27.319 write a check you mean write very large
00:44:29.720 checks you have to be careful that the
00:44:31.040 reason the Supreme Court ruled for super
00:44:32.800 packs is not just about giving you're
00:44:34.520 not you're not giving them the money
00:44:35.640 you're actually speaking yourself so
00:44:37.000 when Elon spends $300 million he's
00:44:39.760 actually spending it many times putting
00:44:41.680 out his own speech or he's putting out
00:44:45.520 what about you Jamal do you think that
00:44:47.160 Soros Elon let's take the names out of
00:44:49.760 it do you think there should be a cap on
00:44:51.440 what you're able to donate to Super Pacs
00:44:53.160 because this does create the massive
00:44:54.720 appearance of impropriety whether it's
00:44:56.640 in Crypt
00:44:57.640 whether it's on the you know Soros on
00:44:59.359 the Democrat side this seems to be I
00:45:02.160 mean I I'm in favor of there being more
00:45:03.920 hard caps whether it's 510 or 25 million
00:45:06.760 I think there needs to be caps and I
00:45:07.839 think we should put a fund together for
00:45:09.440 the last two or three people and let
00:45:10.880 them get that money from the government
00:45:13.040 to run their campaigns like other
00:45:15.119 countries do I think it's important to
00:45:17.079 note that this pendulum
00:45:19.400 has swung pretty wildly out of wax in
00:45:23.200 citizens united yeah and it's not this
00:45:26.160 is not a republic thing meaning there's
00:45:28.599 a whole buch of factions there's the
00:45:30.119 George Soros faction that's true there's
00:45:32.480 the liberal Democrat faction L we forget
00:45:35.440 I think Zuck spent 350 million in 2020
00:45:38.720 oh yeah then there's the kooch brothers
00:45:42.599 faction and then there's what showed up
00:45:44.960 this year with Elon so my point is
00:45:47.000 there's all kinds of pockets of spending
00:45:49.359 in all manner of ways I think the
00:45:51.800 question is should citizens united have
00:45:54.440 allowed this kind of spending and are we
00:45:57.480 better off as a democracy for it and I
00:46:00.800 think what does shamat think the reason
00:46:02.319 why I would be in favor of going back to
00:46:04.240 the way it was is that I think the
00:46:07.040 biggest problem is the redistricting and
00:46:09.000 the jury mandering that happens and the
00:46:11.359 amount of influence that happens
00:46:13.200 Downstream inside of state and local
00:46:16.800 elections and there are just places that
00:46:19.000 are just so sclerotic
00:46:23.160 stuck if you look at the federal despite
00:46:25.720 all the spending you still see at the
00:46:28.520 presidential level like pretty
00:46:30.680 reasonable and healthy competition
00:46:33.400 between two people it's much more
00:46:36.520 difficult to see dynamism lower and
00:46:38.720 lower down ballot and so the reason to
00:46:41.559 get rid of citizens united from my
00:46:43.400 perspective is that you'd have much more
00:46:45.880 vibrant local state mayoral elections
00:46:49.559 those things have huge impacts I think
00:46:51.200 to to Quality okay so you and I are in
00:46:53.680 that camp Joe's in the other freeberg
00:46:55.559 your thoughts you're the desire vote
00:46:57.359 here it's two to one in terms of the
00:47:00.280 panel well you just said to me you you
00:47:02.920 just said to me you think we should go
00:47:04.119 back the Supreme Court's on my side so
00:47:06.599 you guys are in trouble no no yeah I
00:47:08.240 mean but the point of this program
00:47:10.920 sometimes is not just to is to take
00:47:12.680 ownership of your opinion and defend it
00:47:14.880 so I we have I want to see people own it
00:47:17.640 here in the discourse or freeberg you
00:47:19.400 can say pass but you don't get to say
00:47:21.000 nothing okay what does it mean to spend
00:47:25.640 money on on a political point of view
00:47:29.200 exactly what does it mean it it means
00:47:31.960 you can put a book I mean the other side
00:47:33.520 wanted to censor books because like like
00:47:35.760 if I want if I want to pay someone to
00:47:38.000 make a book for me if I want to pay
00:47:39.720 someone if I want to pay 50 people to go
00:47:43.079 and engage the community so I can get
00:47:45.599 some leverage on my time if I want to
00:47:47.359 pay someone to make a website to promote
00:47:49.559 my point of view on something I should
00:47:51.440 be able to do that and if my point of
00:47:53.440 view is related to a vote that Congress
00:47:57.800 might be taking or is related to a
00:48:00.319 candidate that's running for election or
00:48:03.079 is related to taxes or is related to
00:48:05.520 some other social issue I don't know how
00:48:08.079 you can kind of very clearly delineate
00:48:10.520 the difference between some kind of
00:48:12.880 political party or some political
00:48:15.599 candidate versus my having a point of
00:48:17.720 view on an issue if I care very deeply
00:48:20.079 about animal Weare which I do and if I
00:48:22.160 had enough money that I felt like I
00:48:24.240 could spend that money to influence
00:48:26.000 people's point of view you to improve
00:48:28.000 Animal Welfare through laws and through
00:48:30.559 candidates I would spend that money and
00:48:33.040 I should have a right to do so and I
00:48:34.760 shouldn't feel restricted that I can't
00:48:36.200 go publicly express my voice make
00:48:38.760 websites put up Billboards put up
00:48:40.599 posters buy ads and papers telling
00:48:42.599 people how wrong it is the way we treat
00:48:45.319 animals and slaughter them and keep them
00:48:47.160 living for their very short lives in
00:48:49.079 Terrorist conditions I want to be able
00:48:51.040 to express that point of view and so I
00:48:53.200 kind of Veer to this idea can I ask you
00:48:54.839 a question would you do you think that
00:48:56.799 your money spending if the balance of
00:48:58.839 power to get your view was
00:49:01.359 to redistrict
00:49:04.440 certain places so that then you could
00:49:06.680 get a majority of people that were
00:49:08.319 ideologically aligned to you elected
00:49:10.760 would you do that as well forget there's
00:49:12.319 no ads running this is about a different
00:49:14.880 form of electoral influence would you do
00:49:16.680 that so not spending money you're saying
00:49:18.119 like I'm not spending money to you you'd
00:49:19.599 spend money but it's not for ads it's
00:49:21.240 not for how does that work how do you
00:49:22.480 spend money to redistrict you get
00:49:24.960 certain people elected by Trucking
00:49:26.880 people out to vote and then you get that
00:49:29.000 person to join a coalition that then
00:49:31.240 redistricts I mean maybe Trucking people
00:49:33.200 out to vote as an action should be
00:49:34.760 illegal that seems pretty reasonable to
00:49:36.319 me well yeah I mean to your point
00:49:37.559 freeberg you asked like how do you
00:49:39.280 define it what I'm trying to point out
00:49:40.559 to you is for every dollar that goes
00:49:42.040 into politics I think it's I would ask
00:49:45.000 you guys to just suspend belief that
00:49:48.839 100% of that goes to ads no no what I'm
00:49:50.799 trying to say is I would say a very
00:49:52.559 small not a very small 10 10 10 to 20
00:49:55.400 cents goes to ads 80% goes to all kinds
00:49:57.640 of shady stuff and this also canvas by
00:50:00.079 the way you call it Shady but I would
00:50:01.520 argue like what if I want to make a
00:50:02.760 bunch of websites what if I want to make
00:50:05.119 like you know have people go out and
00:50:06.799 express the point of view in the Town
00:50:08.079 Square you know like there are other
00:50:09.920 aspects of what you might what I'm
00:50:11.119 saying that's fine that's in the 10 cent
00:50:13.240 bucket the 80 cents what I'm trying to
00:50:14.760 tell you explicitly is how it's spent
00:50:16.319 today is not in the ways that you think
00:50:18.760 I think that the fact that someone calls
00:50:20.160 it Shady might be because they disagree
00:50:21.760 with my point of view and if they agree
00:50:23.480 with my point of view they might not
00:50:24.520 call I think I think the tactics today
00:50:27.160 look I play with the conditions on the
00:50:28.559 field but if you look at them meaning
00:50:30.839 like using dollar incentives to
00:50:32.680 incentivize people that's allowed today
00:50:35.280 you can pay people to vote today before
00:50:37.920 we had pay them to join a super pack or
00:50:40.240 something like that but let hold on let
00:50:41.400 me let me just get Joe involved here so
00:50:43.119 Joe you heard freeberg you're kind of in
00:50:45.040 alignment I think broadly yeah but we
00:50:47.520 can Define some very specific things
00:50:49.760 that are obviously political like the
00:50:51.480 window of when you spend the money like
00:50:55.079 telling people well because you could
00:50:56.480 say say in the six
00:50:58.319 in I'm not tarting a specific vote I get
00:51:01.480 it I get it if you're not if you're
00:51:02.720 targeting an issue that's one thing but
00:51:04.440 when you tell people she's for they them
00:51:06.720 he's for you that's clearly a political
00:51:09.000 ad now you could take those ads you
00:51:11.319 could take canvasing you could Define a
00:51:13.520 subset of behaviors and you could say
00:51:15.680 you can raise up to this amount of money
00:51:17.839 per person in that way that's me those
00:51:20.720 things are explicitly political when you
00:51:22.599 tell people this is about candidate a
00:51:24.880 versus candidate B if you were say this
00:51:27.200 we're not going to mention any
00:51:28.280 candidates but we're going to talk about
00:51:29.440 your puppies and you trying to increase
00:51:31.520 your Q score here on the goddamn pod by
00:51:33.880 Saving puppies don't be Animal Welfare
00:51:36.079 is a [ __ ] up issue and something you
00:51:38.640 to be agreement with you I just don't
00:51:39.640 like how many points you're scoring with
00:51:40.880 the audience over did you guys see this
00:51:42.240 thing on Instagram my wife show
00:51:43.960 ridiculous I'm Gonna Save five puppies
00:51:45.400 for my Ranch somebody save some cows did
00:51:48.440 you guys see this Instagram reel my wife
00:51:50.240 showed it to me it's like of a of a calf
00:51:53.440 chasing a dog and it cuts to this Asian
00:51:57.000 guy and he's like what's the big deal
00:51:58.920 here what are we talking about like you
00:52:00.599 know you want us to not eat everything
00:52:02.119 blah blah blah and then he realizes that
00:52:03.520 they're talking about the dog versus the
00:52:05.240 the cat don't trigger freeberg don't do
00:52:07.280 that leave freeberg freeberg I got 33
00:52:09.920 ACR of paradise don't laugh I got 33
00:52:12.799 Acres patus I'm going to save every
00:52:14.480 animal in in Central Texas I'm gonna eat
00:52:17.559 them and I and I would give you money to
00:52:18.960 do that got a deal actually I I actually
00:52:23.079 I agree with what jamath was saying
00:52:24.520 about Jerry mandering I think we could
00:52:25.839 use AI for that's a separate
00:52:27.079 conversation it's it's discussing how it
00:52:28.480 works right now however Jason the
00:52:30.160 problem at the end of the day with
00:52:31.640 defining what's political or not is the
00:52:33.119 boundary cases are really tough and you
00:52:34.760 do end up needing effectively
00:52:36.559 effectively a censorship word example is
00:52:38.880 I write I write a book about the dangers
00:52:41.559 of Communism and it explains how it's
00:52:44.119 linked to things going on today and I
00:52:45.799 like give it out at like all these
00:52:47.599 people are gonna be voting I mean
00:52:48.559 there's just so many boundary cases said
00:52:51.000 you can spend up to 10 million a year
00:52:53.000 doing political activity 10 million a
00:52:54.880 year gives you a cap so you can only
00:52:57.280 B this is not political activity it's my
00:52:59.480 art this is this is an artistic piece
00:53:01.920 but when you put the book in and say
00:53:03.359 vote for Biden then we would say okay
00:53:05.839 you put a vote for B you see what I'm
00:53:07.680 saying though it becomes it becomes
00:53:08.920 really complicated I just ran it through
00:53:11.480 grock and what the answer was is that
00:53:15.359 56% of all the spending happens to be on
00:53:19.119 ads and 44% of all dollars in 24 25 was
00:53:22.359 spent on other yeah so there you put
00:53:25.760 canvasing in there I bet you it's 75% so
00:53:28.160 if we just say for those two activities
00:53:30.000 put a hard cap on them I would be for
00:53:31.920 that but let's keep going we got a bunch
00:53:33.880 of about the market Market's let's talk
00:53:36.480 about cor weave all right gentlemen we
00:53:38.240 can't talk about politics all day as
00:53:39.920 exciting as it is let's talk about this
00:53:42.480 cor weave IPO if you don't know cor
00:53:44.599 weave is part of a new type of
00:53:47.960 infrastructure provider called neocloud
00:53:50.559 it's a fancy way of saying using gpus to
00:53:52.799 build data
00:53:54.000 centers this is a really interesting
00:53:55.760 company because they got on to gpus
00:53:57.520 early and they had a lock in on a large
00:54:00.480 number of nvidia's gpus they've uh got
00:54:04.040 32 data centers with 250,000 Nvidia gpus
00:54:08.160 as an example when Elon built the
00:54:11.079 largest fastest uh data center Colossus
00:54:15.200 that was 100,000 so this is you know
00:54:17.520 really really a big company they're
00:54:19.480 going to do an IPO analysts are
00:54:21.160 estimating they're going to raise at
00:54:22.839 least 3.5 billion at over $30 billion
00:54:25.559 doar their secondary was 23 billion in
00:54:29.000 November of 2024 so this is cooking with
00:54:32.119 oil they've got incredible Revenue by
00:54:34.480 the way 1.9 billion in 2024 but if you
00:54:37.160 look at two years ago how much revenue
00:54:38.920 they have the growth is amazing Nick put
00:54:40.920 a chart in here and post because uh it's
00:54:43.280 like a 10x I think each year or
00:54:45.119 something crazy like that when I talked
00:54:46.760 about it on the other pod but they're
00:54:48.799 very unprofitable almost a billion
00:54:50.880 dollars in loss in
00:54:52.799 2024 and that's interest payments on a
00:54:55.240 lot of their debt almost 8 billion in
00:54:58.079 debt huge debt load to buy all these
00:54:59.920 gpus and that has been the question
00:55:01.720 we've been talking about here trth is
00:55:04.440 are these gpus are these neoc clouds
00:55:07.119 fancy way of saying I'll give you couple
00:55:10.040 factoids about cor which I find super
00:55:12.119 impressive so the first question is like
00:55:13.960 you would say why didn't
00:55:15.680 AWS gcp and azour eat these guys for
00:55:19.880 breakfast lunch and dinner and as it
00:55:22.640 turns out they had one very specific
00:55:25.839 technical decision that I think was
00:55:27.400 extremely valuable which is that these
00:55:28.920 guys did not use hypervisors explain
00:55:31.119 what that is so a hypervisor is
00:55:32.920 basically a middle Weare layer of
00:55:34.559 software that allows you to
00:55:36.799 abstract units of compute so that then
00:55:39.319 you can make them available and instead
00:55:41.920 they basically allowed you to write to
00:55:43.559 the bare metal and this very native
00:55:45.559 approach that allowed them to get a lot
00:55:46.920 of traction so it's a really interesting
00:55:49.440 thing to note that just that simple
00:55:51.680 thing like one simple technical design
00:55:54.480 decision can allow you to build what
00:55:57.760 looks like at least from the revenue
00:55:59.839 perspective an incredible business right
00:56:01.839 so kudos to them super awesome to see
00:56:04.799 that you can still maneuver around the
00:56:06.359 big giants I think that that's cool I
00:56:08.760 think the big question with cor weave is
00:56:11.920 what is the period of amortization and
00:56:13.640 the useful life of these gpus from
00:56:16.760 Nvidia and I think that that question is
00:56:18.960 up in the air as you said Jason a lot of
00:56:20.960 their losses are these interest
00:56:23.000 payments and as long as that they have
00:56:26.000 that calculated right in their models
00:56:28.640 that they Ed to borrow all this money to
00:56:30.880 buy all these gpus from Nvidia this is
00:56:33.720 going to be a Killer Business to the
00:56:36.440 extent that they got that calculation
00:56:38.079 wrong meaning we thought the useful life
00:56:40.680 was 10 years but it turned out to be
00:56:42.119 five this business is deeply underwater
00:56:45.000 so I think that that's the bet the bet
00:56:47.880 is they've built an amount of Headway
00:56:50.839 they're going to continue to do this
00:56:53.640 good technical engineering
00:56:56.440 but the other side of it is is the
00:56:57.839 useful life right is the technology
00:57:00.119 curve right is Moore's law and all these
00:57:01.880 other things will they work in its favor
00:57:03.720 or against it and I think that's Jo
00:57:06.039 people say useful lifespan gpus three to
00:57:09.119 five years before the next generation is
00:57:12.520 so much more powerful especially in
00:57:14.839 relation to power consumption that it's
00:57:17.240 worth running it now with servers old
00:57:19.599 CPUs for running Facebook it's a totally
00:57:22.359 different story you can keep those
00:57:23.359 running five to seven years before it's
00:57:25.799 not running them you have to turn them
00:57:27.240 off what do you think here bus you're
00:57:29.079 right there's an economic question on
00:57:30.079 the power and all these things I
00:57:31.160 actually know Brandon he lives nearby me
00:57:32.839 in my house in Montana he's a really
00:57:34.559 smart guy and I think the really
00:57:35.880 interesting thing you know when they
00:57:36.760 built this that I think is relevant
00:57:37.880 going forward is these guys were
00:57:39.400 Commodities Traders and they were
00:57:40.599 originally buying stuff to like mine
00:57:42.680 Bitcoin other stuff like that and they
00:57:44.839 realized as Commodities Traders there's
00:57:46.559 like a certain supply and demand in the
00:57:47.839 market of GPU chips but also of all the
00:57:50.319 data centers by the way and it's really
00:57:52.039 it's really interesting what they did is
00:57:53.160 they locked down the full supply of tons
00:57:56.359 of data centers tons of the power they
00:57:57.760 needed tons of the chips and they're
00:57:59.599 very very thoughtful I mean they're
00:58:00.720 effectively they're Traders and they're
00:58:02.559 and they're very economic and they have
00:58:04.200 I think they have bottled this stuff
00:58:05.280 well that explains the technical
00:58:06.599 decision because they have to have very
00:58:08.440 low latency throughput in order to
00:58:10.880 transact efficiently as Commodities
00:58:12.599 Traders I'm guessing there is one heel
00:58:15.799 here for this company Friedberg they had
00:58:17.839 massive Revenue growth but they have a
00:58:20.599 dependency 60% of the revenue now from
00:58:22.799 Microsoft and Microsoft seems to have
00:58:25.400 done this either it's unclear but maybe
00:58:28.200 to service the open AI deal where they
00:58:30.559 needed to give them a bunch of
00:58:31.760 infrastructure or it might be for Azure
00:58:33.839 it's unclear people have been asking
00:58:35.720 this question for a couple of years now
00:58:37.839 but what do you think of a business with
00:58:39.200 one client with 60% dependency and this
00:58:42.240 is how these things work Jason is they
00:58:43.520 just one client tends to grow really
00:58:45.160 really fast and they they're actually
00:58:46.920 you know so they do this orchestration
00:58:48.319 framework called sunk I know a little
00:58:50.079 bit about it this like really easy for
00:58:51.400 scheduling workflows and batches and all
00:58:53.400 these things that I think a lot of other
00:58:54.720 people are using really well they've
00:58:56.319 just bought weights and biases right
00:58:57.920 which like everyone uses basically
00:59:00.160 that's a great buyes they're killer for
00:59:02.440 training I mean I think these guys
00:59:03.760 crushing training saell said that
00:59:06.119 Microsoft was doing this maybe not for a
00:59:08.720 long-term usage so freeberg your
00:59:11.000 thoughts on Cor
00:59:12.240 weave I'm not as deep as you guys are I
00:59:15.160 remember in
00:59:16.880 2003 I worked for nine months at a
00:59:19.119 private Equity Firm and I would cold
00:59:21.280 call like companies that hadn't raised
00:59:23.640 Venture Capital that were profitable and
00:59:26.359 growing and see if they would take our
00:59:27.640 money that's the business model and I
00:59:29.880 spent a lot of time in the sector of
00:59:32.520 businesses that were called speed
00:59:34.079 doublers I don't know if you guys
00:59:35.720 remember these companies 2003 was before
00:59:38.000 we all had broadband internet so we were
00:59:39.799 a lot of people were using dialup and
00:59:41.599 you could pay $9.99 a month for a speed
00:59:43.720 doubler and what it would do is it would
00:59:45.839 basically on your browser set the server
00:59:48.799 to be their server and they had a cache
00:59:51.319 of many of the popular sites on the
00:59:52.839 internet so when you started browsing
00:59:54.839 the internet on your computer everything
00:59:56.280 loaded faster because they had really
00:59:58.559 fast servers and you got these cashes
01:00:00.720 and these companies dude they were doing
01:00:02.200 like tens of millions of Revenue high
01:00:04.520 margin 50% plus ebit margin and growing
01:00:07.839 like 100% plus a year and I remember we
01:00:11.039 we spent a bunch of time looking at
01:00:12.160 these companies this is right before I
01:00:13.520 joined Google and I was like this feels
01:00:16.160 like a transitory business it's like an
01:00:18.359 Arbitrage between where we were and
01:00:20.559 where we're going and that's what ended
01:00:23.240 up happening many of them just cash
01:00:24.480 flowed out the founders took money they
01:00:26.079 were able to get a really smart private
01:00:27.319 Equity recap done get some money out and
01:00:29.559 run at some low multiple of EA or
01:00:31.720 something and so I worry a little bit
01:00:34.119 about a business like this where there's
01:00:36.720 four or five companies that are each
01:00:38.880 doing 80 billion dollar of capex this
01:00:41.640 year to create infrastructure that
01:00:43.760 effectively starts to replace what these
01:00:45.480 guys are effectively offering out as a
01:00:47.079 service that would be my biggest kind if
01:00:49.319 I was to do diligence on this business
01:00:51.039 that's where I would spend a lot of my
01:00:52.359 time is like guys what's the capacity
01:00:54.760 going to be in a year two sort like when
01:00:56.319 Broadband hit the internet you didn't
01:00:57.520 need speed doublers anymore do you
01:00:59.280 really need to be paying as much as you
01:01:00.920 are today is there going to be as much
01:01:02.599 demand how much is this going to get
01:01:03.960 bundled in with gcp or AWS and so on in
01:01:06.520 the future so that would be my kind of
01:01:08.880 macro hesitation and caution on the
01:01:10.599 diligence as I ran my diligence on this
01:01:12.720 thing you basically need an economist to
01:01:14.440 map this all out it's the same question
01:01:15.640 for data centers in a related way right
01:01:17.640 which you just need to map everything
01:01:18.880 and I I don't have those D those numbers
01:01:20.960 so you're right it's a hard thing to
01:01:22.039 figure out that's right that's right
01:01:23.440 well the founders have control of the
01:01:24.760 company I they
01:01:26.760 sold few they sold a lot maybe it's 150
01:01:29.760 each or yeah but but they've kept most
01:01:31.160 of their position they're smart guys so
01:01:32.760 let's see yeah they still own the
01:01:34.640 majority I don't know so I don't want to
01:01:36.240 speak negatively about the business and
01:01:37.559 I haven't spent much time on it but I
01:01:38.960 mean I think that the worst that can
01:01:40.640 happen if you speak negatively about
01:01:42.039 somebody's business you know you tell us
01:01:44.760 you us Prof for years you tell us no
01:01:49.400 idea what is it like to be on somebody's
01:01:51.839 list for a decade I don't know I mean
01:01:53.640 the ratings keep going up for this week
01:01:55.200 and startups all in so I'll I'll take it
01:01:58.079 shout out are you purposefully starting
01:02:00.319 to dress up Jal by the way because I
01:02:01.760 notice every week now you're wearing a
01:02:03.359 butt I had a speak I had a speaking gig
01:02:05.960 but my friends at
01:02:08.000 Eton reached out to me so I might be
01:02:10.400 trying to do a little gri right now are
01:02:12.520 you plugging right now Laura Piana
01:02:14.039 hasn't reached out but Eton shirts which
01:02:15.839 I'm wearing right now e n you know the
01:02:17.880 famous uh shirt people are they've been
01:02:20.640 reaching out and I also no no no no I
01:02:22.920 got but I'm also saying Tom for's people
01:02:24.720 reached out and said you know that
01:02:26.000 pelvin you can take that off if you want
01:02:27.640 we'll have somebody come over so I just
01:02:29.359 want to shout out my friends over there
01:02:30.480 I have noal deal out the Kon k i t o n
01:02:33.920 jackets I've been wearing k i
01:02:36.480 o jackets on Earth I wear them all the
01:02:39.119 time I love those jackets just saying
01:02:41.119 let's move on way yes and Joe lale's
01:02:44.359 outfits are done by the Wagers the weers
01:02:46.720 in China he gets them specifically made
01:02:48.559 for $17 each recently I was recently
01:02:51.279 sponsored by a company this this service
01:02:53.480 is incredible what they do is when
01:02:55.920 you're
01:02:57.359 flying they they meet you at the FBO and
01:03:00.599 they take your watch and they they set
01:03:02.520 the new time for you so especially if
01:03:04.599 it's a mechanical watch is a very
01:03:06.000 complicated oh this is very important
01:03:07.760 right I you know what I was fly you got
01:03:09.799 to be kidding me that this
01:03:11.720 exists and I had my watch collection and
01:03:14.240 they did this for me when I was flying
01:03:15.760 between Montenegro and maltas absolutely
01:03:18.960 just trolling I'm just trolling this is
01:03:21.400 like for spy villains telling you how to
01:03:23.319 look at the world we should get rid of
01:03:24.720 income tax I'm sure everybody listening
01:03:26.960 like hm really convenient no income tax
01:03:29.319 for the billionaires and sent to
01:03:30.480 millionaires good job guys all right
01:03:32.359 let's keep going down
01:03:34.680 the all right jamat you know we've been
01:03:36.880 going back and forth in the group chat
01:03:38.200 and you've been talking about it
01:03:39.200 publicly maybe Main Street versus Wall
01:03:42.760 Street and what's going on in the
01:03:44.880 markets here because there's EU uh Bond
01:03:47.920 issues we obviously uh it seems like in
01:03:50.680 some ways maybe the Trump campaign is
01:03:53.319 not thinking about the stock market as
01:03:55.279 much as are thinking about the bond
01:03:57.200 market explain to us your take on
01:03:59.079 markets right
01:04:00.160 now yeah I think that there's three
01:04:02.200 markets that are important there's the
01:04:04.520 US long end of the curve so this is the
01:04:06.680 10year bond yield I think then there's
01:04:09.039 the US Equity market and then the most
01:04:13.079 next important Market are the
01:04:15.400 European Bond and Equity markets
01:04:18.079 together and I'll explain why in a
01:04:19.559 second but just on the first view I I
01:04:21.599 mentioned this before but I really do
01:04:23.799 think we're in a secular shift
01:04:26.880 where I think the Maga
01:04:29.520 majority and the base of people that can
01:04:32.920 be a reliable voting Block in the future
01:04:35.640 as I've said before are working in
01:04:38.400 Middle Class folks that don't
01:04:39.760 necessarily own a ton of stocks nor do
01:04:43.160 they own homes of which there's a lot
01:04:45.960 second cohort are people that are
01:04:49.039 pro-innovation and Protek and the third
01:04:51.400 are patriotic business owners I think
01:04:54.000 that cohort is very large and I think
01:04:57.559 that
01:04:59.359 when the core strategist inside of Maga
01:05:02.240 figure this out one of the big takeaways
01:05:05.680 is that they're not going to care about
01:05:07.440 the stock market in Wall Street and a
01:05:10.480 lot of the policies will be viewed
01:05:12.160 through the lens of Main Street and I
01:05:14.760 think that you started to see this
01:05:17.559 rhetoric now one from bessent and we'll
01:05:20.640 play this clip in a second and the
01:05:22.000 second was just today from Trump himself
01:05:24.400 but Nick do you want to play the best
01:05:25.839 clip if you have it I think o over the
01:05:28.520 the medium term which is what we're
01:05:30.200 focused on it's a focus on Main Street
01:05:33.000 wall Street's done Great Wall Street can
01:05:35.160 continue to do fine uh but we have a
01:05:39.119 focus on small business and the
01:05:41.680 consumers so we are going to rebalance
01:05:44.160 the economy we're going to bring
01:05:45.760 manufacturing jobs home that was the
01:05:48.240 first one the second one was just today
01:05:49.920 Nick I sent it to you do you want to
01:05:51.079 just show it to these guys which I think
01:05:52.480 is really interesting so it says here
01:05:54.160 breaking news from I guess on usual well
01:05:56.200 else Trump has just said he's not
01:05:58.279 looking at the stock market okay so not
01:06:00.599 sure I believe that but okay so why is
01:06:02.920 this actually valuable well if we are
01:06:06.559 incentivized if the government of
01:06:08.760 America is incentivized to implement
01:06:10.319 policies that crack the equity markets
01:06:14.119 it's actually really good in some ways
01:06:16.119 number one is if you deflate asset
01:06:18.880 prices you also deflate
01:06:21.760 inflation okay and give an example there
01:06:24.200 for the audience so we make it clear
01:06:26.200 Nvidia is ripping at all-time highs you
01:06:29.400 are like oh wow I'm so cashr you can go
01:06:31.960 get a margin loan you take that money
01:06:33.720 you reinvest it in a second home and a
01:06:35.599 third home you sell some stock you start
01:06:38.119 to buy cars all this other stuff it
01:06:40.000 drives consumptive behavior that on the
01:06:42.680 margin isn't there if the markets were
01:06:45.359 much much lower than this so if you
01:06:47.279 rebase the
01:06:49.520 equity values that people have what you
01:06:52.760 do is you actually depress the amount of
01:06:55.160 free cash flow that they have to spend
01:06:57.160 on other things so it's a deflationary
01:06:59.960 tactic how the bond market reacts to
01:07:02.279 that is if the stock market goes down is
01:07:04.760 you start to become a flight to Quality
01:07:06.960 right oh my gosh there's volatility in
01:07:08.680 the stock market oh my gosh I don't want
01:07:10.680 to deal with the stock market going down
01:07:12.760 let me just sell take some chips off the
01:07:14.480 table and buy 10e bonds when you buy the
01:07:17.000 bonds the interest rate goes down why is
01:07:20.039 that good for America we have1 trillion
01:07:22.240 dollar we need to go out and borrow in
01:07:24.599 the next 9 months
01:07:26.200 and so if we can pay 3% 3.8%
01:07:29.760 4% we save us ourselves trillions of
01:07:32.520 dollars versus if we had to pay four and
01:07:34.240 a half five five and a half% so that's
01:07:37.440 the second
01:07:38.720 thing and then the third thing is that
01:07:41.400 right now what we had this week because
01:07:43.680 of the Ukraine and zalinsky thing is
01:07:45.680 basically Trump say we are totally risk
01:07:47.799 off this war and I'm not going to debate
01:07:50.839 whether that's right or wrong but that's
01:07:52.079 what he said we're going to curil the
01:07:54.119 aid we're not even going to share
01:07:56.440 intelligence they're on their own what
01:07:58.680 did that Force what happened this week
01:08:01.799 was the Europeans had to basically
01:08:03.960 circle the wagons and they said okay
01:08:05.880 we're going to step up and what they
01:08:08.079 announced was a four-year plan to borrow
01:08:11.720 money to invest in
01:08:13.599 defense what they also did which was
01:08:15.920 really interesting is the UK
01:08:17.359 specifically said we're going to borrow
01:08:19.080 it in this clever little way this is
01:08:21.520 their interpretation so that it doesn't
01:08:23.920 actually count in the debt to GDP
01:08:25.679 calculations of my country so they're
01:08:27.679 start they're
01:08:28.679 starting but then so then how did the
01:08:30.880 bond market react to it Nick you can
01:08:32.520 show it they're like you know what guys
01:08:34.359 if you want to fight this war obviously
01:08:36.839 you're allowed to do whatever you want
01:08:38.120 but the cost that you're going to have
01:08:39.560 to pay is going to go up this has been
01:08:42.600 going up every day and you're at a point
01:08:46.319 now where this is severe fiscal pressure
01:08:51.600 on these governments I do not know how
01:08:53.839 they sustain their deficits and raise
01:08:56.759 more debt so all of this is happening
01:08:59.399 all at the same time I think Trump is
01:09:01.080 pro Main Street Equity markets basically
01:09:04.000 do not get bid the bond markets respond
01:09:06.880 positively yields go down good for
01:09:09.040 America they extract themselves from
01:09:11.560 spending programs like again it's more
01:09:15.359 than a spending program but I'll just
01:09:16.560 say it in this context narrowly Russia
01:09:18.719 Ukraine is a spending program that that
01:09:20.399 if you take off the table that balance
01:09:23.040 of responsibility goes to Europe and
01:09:25.560 then the markets are saying this is not
01:09:27.560 right we want this war to end and we're
01:09:28.920 going to make it more expensive for you
01:09:30.120 to litigate it if you put it all
01:09:32.000 together it's a really interesting
01:09:33.960 moment in the markets I haven't seen in
01:09:35.359 a very long time Joe do you think this
01:09:38.799 is the refinancing of our debt is the
01:09:42.158 end game here there's like maybe 10% of
01:09:44.880 people who seem to have fallen in that
01:09:46.759 camp when I queried on these four group
01:09:48.960 chats hey you know if we can depress
01:09:51.120 everything we lower consumption we break
01:09:53.080 inflation even more maybe people lose
01:09:55.640 their jobs you know less
01:09:58.239 consumption and rates go down we have to
01:10:00.679 cut rates three or four times put
01:10:02.800 pressure on the FED then we can maybe
01:10:06.800 refinance our debt which is coming up
01:10:08.920 some percentage of it what do you think
01:10:10.280 of that theory you know Jason jamaat has
01:10:12.120 a lot of interesting thoughts here and I
01:10:13.880 think it's I think it's a very smart
01:10:14.920 analysis I'm not fully aligned it is
01:10:16.719 true Bond markets hate war war is
01:10:18.960 expensive or is inflationary it's very
01:10:21.480 clear Europe is going through okay you
01:10:23.280 know war is more likely for us to spend
01:10:24.880 money that and that hurts them you know
01:10:26.760 in the US I think the number one thing
01:10:28.520 that Scott Besson and Trump would want
01:10:30.480 around this is is to fight for Main
01:10:32.719 Street like they said that that really
01:10:34.080 is you know the kind of populace energy
01:10:35.880 we have right now and so I think they
01:10:37.239 are focused on lower interest rates
01:10:38.440 lower interest rates you know I have
01:10:40.000 some someone who works with me uh their
01:10:41.600 spouse you know as a real estate agent
01:10:43.320 and that they're having a really tough
01:10:44.360 couple years because indust R spiked up
01:10:45.679 if you get IND rates down again there's
01:10:47.280 so many different places in America
01:10:48.760 where people start making money again
01:10:49.920 with with the title companies with the
01:10:51.719 Brokers with there's so many things that
01:10:53.360 happen right with that trickle down yeah
01:10:55.400 it's it's well it's not just trickle
01:10:56.760 down it's like this is the part of the
01:10:58.000 economy that that just really does start
01:11:00.080 to turn on and certain transactions can
01:11:01.800 happen again and and you're right it it
01:11:03.440 is cheaper debt that is that is
01:11:04.679 Advantage as well so I think
01:11:05.920 disinflation is very important and I
01:11:07.800 think we have to find some way to get
01:11:08.880 there chth may be right that it's worth
01:11:10.640 hitting assets to get to this inflation
01:11:12.320 that's something that the Scott could be
01:11:13.480 working on because of all the debt but
01:11:14.880 it is it is true the easiest it's the
01:11:16.960 easiest it's the easiest and we do and
01:11:19.400 we do need it for sure so and I
01:11:21.000 hopefully I think there's some other
01:11:21.920 more clever ways to get there but but
01:11:23.760 but I do like that you said there's some
01:11:25.960 more clever ways to get there obviously
01:11:27.520 we don't want to see 8 n 10%
01:11:29.560 unemployment that's another way to get
01:11:31.199 there and we don't want that because you
01:11:33.520 know Main Street equals jobs so what do
01:11:37.120 what is your other ways to get there
01:11:39.320 well the other ways to get there is
01:11:40.760 there's two there's really two right now
01:11:42.120 in our society that are very positive
01:11:43.800 one of them is a higher productivity
01:11:46.159 through AI I'm working on a ton of
01:11:47.560 things as are sure everyone else doing
01:11:49.440 that like we're doing construction for
01:11:50.560 much cheaper right now government can't
01:11:52.159 do that though right government can't be
01:11:53.639 involved in that that's up to us not to
01:11:55.520 SC I mean David's doing good work we can
01:11:56.920 make sure not to screw it up there's a
01:11:57.960 lot of people trying to screw it up so I
01:11:59.560 think David's job is very important
01:12:00.719 there to get Sam's not here please we
01:12:03.679 and then the and then the second thing
01:12:05.639 is actually cutting spend like just
01:12:07.880 giving out hundreds of billions
01:12:09.080 willy-nilly to Stacy Abrams at all is
01:12:11.760 very inflationary and so so so I think I
01:12:13.920 think cutting spend actually is a very
01:12:15.440 positive thing we could do a lot more of
01:12:16.760 that freeberg you heard the two
01:12:18.800 gentlemen what are your thoughts on the
01:12:21.280 refinancing of Interest as I've done
01:12:24.040 before I'm going to give you incredible
01:12:25.840 leadership credit for 3 years ago on
01:12:27.920 this pod pushing all of us to really
01:12:30.040 think about what would happen if the
01:12:31.520 debt increased another 8 trillion which
01:12:34.280 it did and I think that influenced a lot
01:12:36.960 of people in our circles and obviously
01:12:38.880 that's something that the president took
01:12:41.239 on when none of us thought he would any
01:12:43.920 president would ever take on that issue
01:12:46.440 how much pain do you think Trump is
01:12:49.320 willing to take with the stock market
01:12:50.679 going down in order to refin the debt
01:12:52.560 the debt is he willing to be incredibly
01:12:54.239 unpopular is he willing to deal with the
01:12:57.400 criticism from Wall Street and from
01:13:00.360 Equity holders over some sustained
01:13:02.199 period and how much would he be if it
01:13:03.639 goes down the market goes down 10 20% do
01:13:06.320 you think he's going to cry uncle or you
01:13:08.440 think he's willing to take that kind of
01:13:09.600 pain freeberg like I said I I don't know
01:13:11.520 about Trump there's a you know I would
01:13:13.360 say 6040 I'd be right 40% I'd be wrong
01:13:16.040 so I I don't know people are here for
01:13:18.040 that that's actually a pretty good ratio
01:13:19.440 in poker if you can win that many hint
01:13:21.400 yeah I mean I'd say 60% he's probably
01:13:23.639 different than Trump 1.0 and he's
01:13:26.080 probably less influenced by the
01:13:28.639 short-term Rumblings about the market
01:13:31.120 okay and he's probably listening to
01:13:33.600 bessent on this one
01:13:37.320 although you know I I I think it's it's
01:13:39.639 got to be a complicated relationship
01:13:41.280 between the two of them at the moment I
01:13:43.639 I do think that he is aware and I would
01:13:46.080 imagine the administration generally
01:13:48.040 with bessent and others in in um kind of
01:13:50.679 key leadership positions are trying to
01:13:53.400 make the case that if we can get
01:13:55.560 rates
01:13:57.639 down we have an opportunity to kind of
01:14:00.280 refinance this1 trillion that's coming
01:14:02.520 due in the next 12 months and get
01:14:05.360 ourselves into a kind of more
01:14:06.679 sustainable financing position there's
01:14:09.360 still the fiscal position which is how
01:14:11.199 are we spending money and how are we
01:14:12.600 spending money over time that needs to
01:14:14.639 be addressed this is this is the central
01:14:16.600 question you're totally right let's
01:14:18.400 address that specifically with Ukraine
01:14:21.360 you're a bit of uh a hawk an American
01:14:24.760 except jist Joe and
01:14:27.320 um we are looking at a situation where
01:14:30.159 we
01:14:31.040 spent 175 billion there were some other
01:14:34.080 numbers that Trump was floating around
01:14:35.360 that were
01:14:36.840 Incorrect and they got fact checked 175
01:14:39.560 billion is what we're actually in for
01:14:41.239 according to all accounts this was done
01:14:43.480 as I said many times on this very
01:14:45.320 program and got laughed at and joked
01:14:47.760 about done on a lease loan Trump because
01:14:51.800 these things were done on a lease loan
01:14:53.520 now has the upper hand with zinsky and
01:14:55.880 he's a great negotiator and he said we
01:14:57.480 want 500 billion back don't need to make
01:15:00.679 this about dollars and cents here
01:15:02.080 because obviously this is life and death
01:15:04.159 and people's democracy we're talking
01:15:06.400 about their sovereignty but that 175
01:15:09.560 billion if he gets that 500 billion back
01:15:12.280 that's a 42% irr in three years on this
01:15:15.840 even if we just got our money back that
01:15:17.159 would be fine for the American people
01:15:18.639 how do you look at the war in Ukraine
01:15:20.760 both financially and in terms of
01:15:23.320 containing Putin and
01:15:25.679 finally in terms of our participation in
01:15:28.239 NATO is it time for us to leave NATO Joe
01:15:30.239 lale wow well you know Jason Putin's a
01:15:32.960 bad guy that's number one he's shouldn't
01:15:35.040 have inv thank you for saying that it's
01:15:36.480 refreshing to hear it on this podcast
01:15:38.679 you know I I do think the last
01:15:39.920 Administration mismanaged it I don't
01:15:41.440 think he would have invaded with Trump
01:15:42.560 as president he certainly would have
01:15:44.040 invaded with competent person threaten
01:15:45.960 him so but you know but now we have to
01:15:47.719 have peace and I do want peace I don't
01:15:49.199 want to have the war continuing but to
01:15:50.679 get peace you got to get both sides to
01:15:52.480 come to the table I prefer peace through
01:15:54.400 strength prefer being really strong on
01:15:56.159 Putin and showing why he has to have
01:15:57.480 peace but then you need zilinski to be a
01:15:59.080 partner for it too and I do think listen
01:16:01.040 I do think zilinski had the wrong idea
01:16:03.560 on the White House last week he should
01:16:04.840 have been thanking them he should have
01:16:05.920 come more humbly he should have actually
01:16:07.679 been directed towards really wanting
01:16:09.280 peace and listen I I I agree that
01:16:11.159 Ukraine's a very corrupt country we may
01:16:12.800 find out that he and his cronies have
01:16:14.800 been taking a bunch of money I don't
01:16:15.679 know if they are or not either way he
01:16:17.520 has not really been signaling the right
01:16:19.120 way to be open to peace and a piece that
01:16:21.480 does I think have to give up a little
01:16:22.520 bit of Ukraine in order to get there I
01:16:23.760 think that's the option on the table
01:16:25.080 right now and that's the direction I
01:16:26.360 want about the NATO question what's the
01:16:28.199 you know and thank you for being so
01:16:29.560 candid here what's the the NATO outcome
01:16:33.960 here is it time for maybe Europe to just
01:16:37.639 go it alone because they don't seem to
01:16:39.600 like what happened last Friday at the
01:16:41.280 White House they yeah and and maybe do
01:16:43.840 you think it's time maybe that we we bow
01:16:45.920 out and let them arm up this is really
01:16:48.600 tough for me because some of the people
01:16:49.840 I care about most in the world uh live
01:16:51.560 in places like Germany and and around
01:16:53.239 there and I want them to be safe I also
01:16:55.120 think that the historic relationship
01:16:56.440 between the UK and the US is this very
01:16:58.280 very valuable thing that we have they
01:17:00.239 shouldn't just be tossed aside these are
01:17:01.679 these are critical very longtime allies
01:17:03.800 and cousins you know I think Europe's in
01:17:06.360 a very very bad place it's very
01:17:08.040 dysfunctional man it's it's it's I do
01:17:09.600 not see European civilization going the
01:17:11.719 right way the next 20 or 30 years I
01:17:13.159 think JD's right to criticize them on on
01:17:15.400 anti-free speech on like you know
01:17:16.679 arresting people who criticize the
01:17:18.679 Islamic threat like more than the people
01:17:20.639 actually doing the rapes and stuff it's
01:17:22.040 crazy these places have lost their minds
01:17:23.840 you know it's bonkers so yeah do do I
01:17:25.960 want to to totally give it up no but do
01:17:28.440 I want to demand fiercely that the
01:17:30.520 certain things get fixed and to use our
01:17:32.480 foreign policy apparatus to make sure we
01:17:34.760 fix those things if we're going to stay
01:17:35.840 in the relationship 100% what do you
01:17:38.040 think chamat this NATO question seems
01:17:40.440 like Europe is kind of signaling that
01:17:42.520 they're willing to go at alone and
01:17:44.600 should the United States just say okay
01:17:47.080 go for it we're we're out because that's
01:17:49.320 literally what sax retweeted recently
01:17:51.199 just said hey we're out it's your
01:17:52.719 problem um and I think the
01:17:54.239 administration has given him free reign
01:17:55.719 to to discuss the topic he T discussed
01:17:57.600 it here for many years what are your
01:17:59.320 thoughts should we be out on NATO well I
01:18:01.840 think the question is when do these
01:18:04.000 transnational organizations outlive
01:18:06.400 their utility that's the question on the
01:18:09.040 table and it's not just a question for
01:18:11.440 NATO but it's a question for a bunch of
01:18:13.400 these other things the
01:18:15.000 who NATO the United Nations there's many
01:18:18.719 of these
01:18:19.880 organizations what you've seen is that
01:18:22.719 there are
01:18:25.360 competitive organizations now that are
01:18:27.440 just as important if not more so if you
01:18:31.080 didn't like OPEC well then there was
01:18:33.360 this OPEC Plus+ thing if you didn't like
01:18:36.800 how the Europeans and the Americans did
01:18:39.920 intelligence gathering then all of a
01:18:41.440 sudden five eyes came out of nowhere if
01:18:43.360 you didn't like the G7 there's the
01:18:46.000 bricks right so there's this tendency
01:18:49.840 for the world to create these startups
01:18:53.400 to try to challenge incumbent
01:18:55.679 as the conditions on the ground change I
01:18:58.840 think the most important thing right now
01:19:00.440 the Europeans need to do is acknowledge
01:19:02.280 this one critical fact the individual
01:19:05.239 governments of Europe are vibrant and
01:19:07.800 Powerful the European Union itself was
01:19:11.639 created almost without any real teeth
01:19:14.080 and so what happened is the folks there
01:19:16.120 started to pass inordinate numbers of
01:19:18.120 laws yeah and that has made it really
01:19:20.600 complicated to be a European company a
01:19:22.679 European Citizen and that has to get
01:19:25.080 sorted out what is the real decision
01:19:27.600 there is it about being Italian is it
01:19:29.719 about being European what is the
01:19:31.679 separation and I don't think that that's
01:19:33.520 clear and I think once they figure that
01:19:35.120 out all this other stuff is much easier
01:19:36.920 to figure out well you also have yeah
01:19:39.560 other organizations interpo right we
01:19:41.880 have that you have the UN I mean it is
01:19:44.159 maybe time to just
01:19:46.880 reerrr BG what do you think I think that
01:19:50.000 there is a viable case for a peaceful
01:19:54.280 trans I to kind of a
01:19:59.120 multi-polar power
01:20:01.120 Dynamic and if you're a techn
01:20:06.360 pessimist you're going to have a point
01:20:08.360 of view that there are more limited
01:20:10.199 resources available to humans on Earth
01:20:12.800 and therefore we have to have influence
01:20:14.560 to access those resources if you're a
01:20:17.400 techno Optimist you will believe that
01:20:20.639 through Ai and Automation and all these
01:20:23.920 other Technologies that we could spend
01:20:25.480 quite a bit of time around that we are
01:20:28.239 going to have abundant housing abundant
01:20:31.239 fuel abundant materials and generally an
01:20:34.760 abundance of everything that one
01:20:36.840 particular group might demand or need
01:20:40.080 and you don't need to go be an Empire to
01:20:42.639 access the
01:20:43.920 resources that your people are demanding
01:20:46.679 and what I mean is the mining industry
01:20:49.320 is a good example there was this
01:20:50.760 discovery which I think we put on the
01:20:51.920 docket for the science Corner today of a
01:20:55.239 giant thorium Reserve in inner Mongolia
01:20:57.520 which can be used to make a thorium
01:20:58.960 molten salt reactor and there's enough
01:21:00.400 Thorium in this Reserve in China to
01:21:03.520 produce enough energy for 60,000 years
01:21:06.239 of consumption based on current
01:21:08.000 consumption
01:21:09.080 rates I saw a fantastic presentation
01:21:12.480 this week by a startup that's uh using
01:21:15.760 Ai and other sensing Technologies to
01:21:19.159 identify new Rare Earth deposits in the
01:21:22.360 crust of the earth that we have
01:21:24.080 absolutely no visibility into today and
01:21:26.520 many of our assumptions about how much
01:21:29.199 availability there is of certain rare
01:21:31.639 earth metals is wrong and that there
01:21:34.159 actually may be many many many orders of
01:21:35.960 magnitude more material available to us
01:21:37.760 to mine and the technology for mining is
01:21:40.040 getting better the technology for
01:21:41.320 discovering these deposits is improving
01:21:42.600 and so on so in that world where
01:21:44.639 suddenly I can make all the food I want
01:21:46.280 everyone can be fed there's plenty of
01:21:48.040 land there's plenty of housing there's
01:21:49.600 plenty of water there's automation that
01:21:51.920 and robots that are serving me and all
01:21:53.400 this sort of amazing
01:21:55.120 that's coming cury do I really need to
01:21:57.719 be having aing conflict with Russia and
01:22:00.159 China over access to some jungle or some
01:22:03.520 plot of land on the other side of the
01:22:05.560 planet or can I live sustainably on in
01:22:09.920 my country and everyone's going to be
01:22:11.199 generally happy so I think that this
01:22:13.440 idea that maybe the US exits NATO and
01:22:16.760 the US dials down its level of conflict
01:22:19.920 and opposition to Russia and or China is
01:22:23.080 a pretty reasonable and I would argue
01:22:24.840 maybe even a techno optimistic point of
01:22:26.760 view and you know we may find that in
01:22:29.360 the next couple of years we start to
01:22:31.159 really believe it and if we start to
01:22:33.560 believe it all the things that we're
01:22:35.000 fighting over today you don't really
01:22:37.120 need to fight over anymore except for
01:22:40.560 the expansionist intentions of
01:22:42.560 individuals which is a sociological
01:22:44.600 phenomenon which may still continue but
01:22:47.440 I'm not sure that you need to be
01:22:49.159 investing as much resources as we have
01:22:50.840 historically so I would argue maybe nato
01:22:53.880 in a mult poar world of abundance isn't
01:22:56.960 as necessary as it has been in the past
01:22:58.679 Century which was a world that was
01:23:00.199 limited in resources fighting for Access
01:23:02.639 and a growing global population
01:23:04.360 particularly in the developed world in
01:23:05.719 the west that's made it a necessity to
01:23:08.239 maintain us Primacy and US policing of
01:23:11.040 the world and I know others might have a
01:23:12.880 point of view that's a little bit
01:23:13.840 different on that but I just think we
01:23:15.760 this is I think actually what you're
01:23:17.040 talking about is a Star Trek beautiful
01:23:19.239 version of abundance in the world if
01:23:21.800 these Rare Earth minerals create
01:23:23.120 unlimited energy and your energy
01:23:24.560 independent you look at the world
01:23:25.719 differently and and Joe we certainly in
01:23:28.040 America look at the world differently as
01:23:30.400 we're all gen xers here
01:23:32.040 basically we look at the world much
01:23:33.960 differently now since we have energy
01:23:35.679 Independence than we did under Bush and
01:23:38.639 and these uh F Wars you know in the
01:23:42.040 Middle East yeah I mean listen yeah and
01:23:44.280 I I'm I'm one of the most optimistic
01:23:45.920 people I call myself the American
01:23:47.239 Optimist Jason as you know have
01:23:49.360 greatone of us have been on yet app of
01:23:53.320 get you on the we live together I mean
01:23:55.840 had sacks on have you had sacks on at
01:23:57.199 least American Optimist people people
01:23:58.679 are too busy to come on I'll try to get
01:24:00.040 you so for four with best's got it okay
01:24:02.600 all right I gotta work on it listen I I
01:24:04.880 would love AI to get to the point I
01:24:06.400 think it will where it starts to
01:24:07.520 accelerate growth where this energy
01:24:09.239 stuff could be mind more easily but
01:24:10.600 until I'd say until we're at at least
01:24:12.480 five six% growth because we are going to
01:24:14.239 the postcar city world we don't know
01:24:15.880 what it's coming I do still think global
01:24:17.520 trade really matters I do think Global
01:24:19.360 Security for ourselves like we don't
01:24:21.159 want random people with nuclear
01:24:22.719 proliferation so there there are issues
01:24:24.520 that are going to affect all of us but I
01:24:26.199 think Dave makes a really great point
01:24:27.760 that it is becoming less important over
01:24:29.639 time it's true let's talk about this
01:24:31.560 chat GPT I guess they came out with 4.5
01:24:34.480 it was such a dud I didn't even realize
01:24:36.360 that they launched it chiman you monitor
01:24:39.119 this or freeberg did you try it because
01:24:40.800 I've been using grock as my default now
01:24:44.440 then Gemini then chat GPT that's my
01:24:46.520 order right now because I wanted to see
01:24:48.679 how good grock is and man grock is
01:24:51.199 really caught up and I don't have an
01:24:52.960 interest here in uh you know I don't
01:24:55.040 have equity in any of these comp well I
01:24:56.440 own Google in the public markets but I
01:24:58.480 don't own the other two but pretty
01:25:00.480 amazing yeah what what do you think of
01:25:02.600 this 4.5 dud and what what it means
01:25:05.480 chamal well I use them in in the
01:25:08.480 companyb building context and
01:25:10.639 specifically at 8090 because of what
01:25:12.400 we're building and what I would tell you
01:25:14.239 is that I think
01:25:16.440 anthropic just continues to do an
01:25:18.480 incredible job I think Claud
01:25:22.480 37 is it just kicks
01:25:25.520 ass oh you're you're on Claud for you're
01:25:28.400 using on the back end yeah we use it for
01:25:30.360 a lot of automated code generation got
01:25:32.639 it and its models on code generation I
01:25:35.600 think are just exceptional it they're
01:25:37.320 they are the best in market then what I
01:25:39.560 would say is as a
01:25:40.960 consumer I've mostly flipped my usage to
01:25:43.840 Gro 3 yeah and the reason is that it's
01:25:46.679 in line with where I consume most of my
01:25:48.719 information it's elegantly
01:25:51.480 integrated inside of X it's point this
01:25:54.800 out to explain it to people when you're
01:25:56.199 in Twitter now X on the top right hand
01:25:59.000 of a tweet there's an xai button when
01:26:01.000 you click it it just gives you the full
01:26:02.760 context of the Tweet so I was reading
01:26:04.679 one of dar's from Uber's tweets about
01:26:08.119 autonomy I guess they added two more
01:26:09.440 Partners when I clicked it it gave me
01:26:11.400 more than I ever could want it was
01:26:12.840 almost like a deep research of the
01:26:14.320 context of a very short retweet he did
01:26:16.840 and I didn't have to cut and paste and
01:26:18.360 form a question so owning a social
01:26:21.360 network equals instant and here we're
01:26:23.760 going to show with Joe lonsdale's where
01:26:25.880 he says Hey listen the you know the the
01:26:27.600 crypto tax feels like taxation to me and
01:26:29.960 look it goes and finds four web pages
01:26:31.800 you can see there it tells you which
01:26:33.320 ones Wikipedia and um CNBC amongst them
01:26:37.560 and then it gives Joe's position this is
01:26:39.880 like very elegant this is super elegant
01:26:43.440 and I think there's a small tweak to
01:26:45.320 this okay that Elon and I were talking
01:26:49.000 about actually onx which is then just
01:26:50.760 the nature of being able to analyze it
01:26:52.480 post for its veracity becomes really
01:26:54.239 valuable that extra little thing when
01:26:56.520 it's available I think will have a
01:26:58.920 really big impact on how people use it
01:27:00.639 in this context so I use gr for the
01:27:02.760 consumer applications for all of our
01:27:05.040 code generation we're using Sonet 37
01:27:07.480 it's
01:27:08.800 exceptional which is anthropics which is
01:27:11.040 doing a major round of funding got it
01:27:12.719 okay yeah and and I think like the the
01:27:14.639 thing with the GPT 45 is that it's kind
01:27:18.560 of like good now here's here's a tangent
01:27:20.920 let me just do a small little rant which
01:27:22.719 is
01:27:24.360 we're at the bleeding edge of where
01:27:26.440 these benchmarks are useful meaning part
01:27:29.040 of why Jason maybe you weren't
01:27:30.800 necessarily watching this as closely and
01:27:32.760 I think where the media and the
01:27:35.000 sensemaking organizations get confused
01:27:37.040 is they don't know now what to say
01:27:39.639 because they'll say hey look at how I
01:27:41.159 did on sbench look at how I did on IMO
01:27:43.880 look at how I did on
01:27:45.520 Amy and the problem the Dirty Little
01:27:47.800 Secret of these model makers is that
01:27:50.639 these guys are so trained on the evals
01:27:52.840 that they're overfitting yeah and all
01:27:55.119 this overfitting basically makes it
01:27:56.679 pretty
01:27:57.760 unreliable what this means to translate
01:27:59.800 into plain English for humans listening
01:28:01.639 is they basically are optimizing for the
01:28:04.320 test that are The Benchmark which is
01:28:06.320 kind of like a person in high school or
01:28:08.639 you know optimizing for the SATs it
01:28:10.440 doesn't mean they're going to be a great
01:28:11.360 student but it may mean that they just
01:28:12.719 spent a lot of time taking sat tests
01:28:14.880 yeah so we have we have one problem
01:28:16.480 which is that I think it would be very
01:28:18.080 valuable for the industry that it be
01:28:19.639 solved which is that we need to have
01:28:22.119 extremely difficult and always changing
01:28:25.480 third party independent verifiable
01:28:27.520 benchmarks oh that's a great idea like
01:28:29.600 the safety test for cars is that's not
01:28:32.159 run by the companies got it less about
01:28:34.360 safety though more about capability sure
01:28:36.520 and I think if we're reporting on that
01:28:38.199 then these leaps will mean something
01:28:39.679 more than what they are today right so
01:28:41.440 got it when Alibaba pushes Gwen this
01:28:44.400 week it was an exceptional model it's
01:28:47.000 probably one of the better open source
01:28:48.679 if not the best open source model out
01:28:50.280 there deep seeks I think is also quite
01:28:52.159 good it doesn't get any pressing anymore
01:28:54.480 so I think we're starting to get to this
01:28:56.000 place where there's such abundance that
01:28:59.080 actually people are just kind of like
01:29:00.679 overwhelmed with all the choice and they
01:29:02.280 don't know how to differentiate this is
01:29:04.000 like a 100 Michelin star restaurants
01:29:06.199 opening up in your city you just don't
01:29:07.639 have enough meals to eat it we we're
01:29:09.480 we're basically drowning in abundance to
01:29:12.239 free Berg's point we I don't think we
01:29:14.320 understand exactly how golden how golden
01:29:17.239 this golden age is in terms distribtion
01:29:19.960 distribution becomes really important I
01:29:21.560 think that's why absolutely inside
01:29:24.440 valuable but also think Google just that
01:29:26.719 they're going to drop an button into the
01:29:29.320 front search page I don't know if you
01:29:31.320 guys saw that but no Google's doing it
01:29:32.880 when you're logged in you will get the
01:29:34.639 snippet at the top inside of YouTube
01:29:37.320 they're doing summaries of the chat and
01:29:39.920 the comments and then you think about
01:29:41.840 what meta could do you know they already
01:29:43.480 put the AI box up there but you know
01:29:45.119 they'll they'll knock some of that
01:29:46.679 off Google front door like google.com
01:29:49.960 does anyone use that
01:29:51.520 anymore well I mean Google searches are
01:29:53.719 still going and Facebook is about to
01:29:55.520 launch a competitor to chat and gr yeah
01:29:58.840 well they're going to do a straight up a
01:30:00.320 standalone app and the thing that they
01:30:02.440 are so good at is whenever they launch
01:30:04.040 an app it doesn't matter when they
01:30:05.440 launch it they'll just get it to a
01:30:06.840 billion people yeah I mean that that is
01:30:09.639 uh super TR all this I think leads
01:30:12.320 to so much abundance what I'm I'm seeing
01:30:15.679 in startups I was the first investor in
01:30:17.639 a company called superum very elegant
01:30:20.239 software luxury software for email
01:30:22.520 productivity give it a shot
01:30:24.600 what he did
01:30:26.000 was I didn't mean that's a super plug
01:30:28.159 here but anyway I I'm so in love with
01:30:30.080 the company and the founder I I just had
01:30:32.000 them on this weekend startups he's like
01:30:33.239 one of the best product Minds I've ever
01:30:35.159 met extraordinary and superum now
01:30:39.159 because it's gotten so cheap to do AI
01:30:41.600 that they are composing in this beta I
01:30:43.920 in all of the replies to your email in
01:30:46.880 real time on the back end and you can
01:30:48.320 see potential drafts they summarize
01:30:50.239 everything even if you never read the
01:30:51.639 summary that would be cost prohibitive
01:30:54.800 six to 12 months ago but now it's a
01:30:57.000 no-brainer and because they're paid
01:30:58.400 software it's like so this is going to
01:31:00.840 get very interesting very quick Joe your
01:31:03.119 thoughts on this uh abundance yeah I'm
01:31:05.239 actually building something on email
01:31:06.440 like you said that let works with your
01:31:07.719 team to automatically kind of like you
01:31:09.800 know create reports on everything that
01:31:11.280 comes in and rout it for you because a
01:31:12.440 lot of our friends when you're a CEO you
01:31:14.239 basically become a traffic cop it's
01:31:16.320 actually the email is gonna do it for
01:31:17.600 you it's gonna be that'd be really nice
01:31:19.119 but listen I'm invested in grock 3 and
01:31:20.880 I'm biased towards Elon but you know a
01:31:23.080 lot of our companies will build on top
01:31:24.360 of multiple of them as well and you I
01:31:26.040 think you're talking about Coen I'm you
01:31:28.400 know in cognition I a lot of my
01:31:30.000 companies using Devon it's actually just
01:31:31.440 like crushing it this stuff's getting
01:31:32.719 like 10 15% better every month it's uh
01:31:35.719 it's really amazing and it's good for
01:31:36.920 companies like that I'm mostly that
01:31:38.040 level where I'm like using all of them
01:31:39.320 or using a bunch of them that so I love
01:31:41.199 the fact there's all this competition
01:31:42.360 because just makes it cheaper and better
01:31:43.520 for me for all my companies I'm building
01:31:45.600 and and it's it's not slowing down is
01:31:47.679 the other piece of this no it's getting
01:31:49.159 better it's scary actually I thought it
01:31:50.440 would I thought it would ASM toote and
01:31:51.560 it hasn't so amazing no that's that's
01:31:53.639 the part that's so fascinating to me and
01:31:56.520 then there's a really interesting Ripple
01:31:58.960 that I don't know if you guys are aware
01:32:00.320 of yet but journalists who have been
01:32:02.679 losing their jobs at a tremendous Pace
01:32:04.440 are now being hired by data aggregators
01:32:07.199 to come in look at queries let's say you
01:32:10.119 had an expertise in agriculture free
01:32:12.159 birg they'll pay you and I actually saw
01:32:13.600 one of these job descriptions 40 bucks
01:32:15.800 an hour to sit there and answer
01:32:17.320 questions about agriculture look at
01:32:19.000 answers and refine them and do
01:32:20.960 reinforcement learning we're going to
01:32:22.920 have a new job class which is people who
01:32:25.520 train AIS and people who fact check AIS
01:32:28.520 and refine AIS and this could be a 50 to
01:32:32.159 $150,000 a year job because every time
01:32:34.760 you make the AI a little better
01:32:36.199 everybody on the planet gets to benefit
01:32:39.360 from it this is an extraordinary new job
01:32:41.360 career I don't know what it's going to
01:32:42.440 be called reinforcement learner I don't
01:32:44.679 know freeberg you get the last take here
01:32:47.600 great job on the abundance angle which
01:32:50.119 just pushed a really great discussion
01:32:51.639 here wrap us up with your thoughts on
01:32:53.920 these llms and the pace of AI I just
01:32:56.520 agree with chamat I think it's like you
01:32:58.199 got a lot of great stuff here it's
01:32:59.960 changing every week I'm not paying
01:33:01.400 attention to the details anymore new
01:33:03.360 models come out every week this is like
01:33:05.480 when the internet launched new websites
01:33:07.480 you know like this is this is carrying
01:33:09.239 us forward it's impossible to dissect
01:33:11.800 and predict what's going to win when and
01:33:15.159 why right now what are you um obsessed
01:33:17.119 with in the AI front is there are there
01:33:19.040 things out I use I use chat GPT research
01:33:22.000 a lot the Deep research Arch right where
01:33:24.600 fires off a bunch of web pages okay and
01:33:26.280 you're paying that means the 200 bucks a
01:33:27.920 month or you I pay 200 a month yeah I
01:33:30.320 find I find it very good yeah and then
01:33:32.320 um we build everything at oh Hollow on
01:33:34.080 gcp and we run a bunch of different
01:33:36.080 models that's Google's Cloud for people
01:33:38.280 who don't know thatr name got it and
01:33:39.760 then we run models they're incredible
01:33:42.360 yeah yeah lots of different tools but
01:33:44.760 it's awesome hey as we wrap here we're
01:33:47.159 following our Muse here at Allin

01:36:06.520 really big deal to it $50 and it was
01:36:08.719 worth it you play the game you start and
01:36:10.600 stop it as fast as you could that was
01:36:11.960 that was exactly remember that I had one
01:36:14.280 on
01:36:15.080 each I was doubling

01:37:33.520 everybody we're suited up we're suited
01:37:35.880 up because the Zar The Wolf of the White
01:37:38.920 House is here my brother David Sachs we
01:37:42.280 were trying to get you on the program
01:37:43.560 you were going to make a drop in to talk
01:37:44.960 about all this great crypto news coming
01:37:46.840 out of the White House and uh let's face
01:37:49.080 it this was a um some people saying
01:37:51.920 chaotic some people say intense this is
01:37:53.960 a pretty amazing intense week for the
01:37:56.639 administration so we'll get into a
01:37:57.800 little bit of that but you're here
01:37:59.159 specifically to talk about the crypto
01:38:02.560 Reserve so welcome back to your program
01:38:05.080 the Allin podcast David sax good to be
01:38:08.119 back I see that you suited up here yeah
01:38:10.800 I mean I figured for people who uh
01:38:13.199 weren't here for the pre-show I get on
01:38:15.360 saak is wearing a white shirt and a tie
01:38:17.199 I'm wearing a Blazer and a white shirt
01:38:19.480 so I'm like ah I got to go put a tie on
01:38:21.119 he's like ah J C wear a blazer I got to
01:38:22.840 go get a blazer so then we came back and
01:38:24.840 here we are and uh right well look I I
01:38:26.719 just have to correct one thing I think
01:38:27.880 it's been a very smooth week at the
01:38:29.199 White House the president has lived up
01:38:32.080 to one of his campaign promises this is
01:38:33.920 not something new remember you go all
01:38:36.159 the way back to his National speech
01:38:37.520 during the campaign and he re reiterated
01:38:39.400 this many times that he wanted to create
01:38:41.760 a strategic Bitcoin Reserve sometimes he
01:38:43.800 called it a digital asset stockpile what
01:38:45.920 we've ultimately done here is both he
01:38:48.599 also in his week one EO on crypto you
01:38:50.719 guys remember I came on the show to talk
01:38:52.000 about that he asked our president's
01:38:54.119 working group on digital asset to
01:38:55.480 evaluate the idea of a reserve or
01:38:58.239 stockpile and we made a recommendation
01:39:00.520 and this Administration is moving at
01:39:02.440 Tech speed it's really great to work for
01:39:05.400 an Administration where you can actually
01:39:06.639 get things done and things move quickly
01:39:08.599 we made our recommendation and then we
01:39:10.199 work with the lawyers to implement it
01:39:11.960 and President signed it last night but
01:39:14.239 this is fully consistent with everything
01:39:15.719 he's he's always said agree on that the
01:39:18.760 uh I guess the one criticism that you're
01:39:20.599 going to get when you go face the media
01:39:21.920 so I might want to put it here is the
01:39:23.119 order in which you're doing things
01:39:24.520 sometimes Mr Trump is very uh expressive
01:39:27.239 on the social medias which is better
01:39:29.320 than let's say the previous
01:39:30.760 administration which just wasn't
01:39:32.040 available and and incognitive decline so
01:39:35.280 I guess the the the question of he
01:39:37.440 announces something and then you guys
01:39:40.000 explain it deeper is that the optimal
01:39:41.840 way to do this should we not worry about
01:39:44.560 it should you come out with like more
01:39:46.599 official stuff I guess that's the move
01:39:48.639 fast break things that we are used to in
01:39:51.040 Silicon Valley but that people you know
01:39:53.440 know whether it's in business or maybe a
01:39:55.840 little concerned about that things are
01:39:57.880 maybe different now in the White House
01:40:01.199 and and in how we're running our
01:40:02.280 government maybe you could expand on
01:40:03.679 that have you ever considered that maybe
01:40:05.040 you just had an overreaction to a tweet
01:40:07.560 well okay so if we're going to place the
01:40:09.760 blame on
01:40:11.000 me I wasn't the only one the original
01:40:14.000 crypto ogs were like wait a second why
01:40:15.880 is he picking these three and not these
01:40:17.760 three you know so that made a lot of
01:40:20.360 people putting myself out of it like
01:40:21.880 whoa what's going on here is he picking
01:40:23.520 favorites and that's I guess everybody's
01:40:25.080 big concern so maybe you could a sage
01:40:27.199 we're not yeah we're not picking
01:40:28.639 favorites obviously except I will say
01:40:30.520 this we do think Bitcoin is special and
01:40:32.719 I can get it to to the reasons why expl
01:40:34.880 why that's a great thing yeah well I
01:40:36.560 mean bitcoin's the original
01:40:37.760 cryptocurrency it's the first one it's
01:40:40.239 the only one that doesn't have an issuer
01:40:42.440 right it's it's very decentralized it's
01:40:44.320 you know in crypto they call this the
01:40:45.480 Immaculate Conception we don't really
01:40:46.920 know how it got here we don't know who
01:40:48.800 Satoshi is it's almost mystical you
01:40:51.159 would say yes it's the most valuable it
01:40:53.560 has a $2 trillion market cap and it's
01:40:55.440 the most secure it's ever been hacked
01:40:56.920 right so we're now you know over 15
01:40:58.440 years into this journey and there's been
01:41:00.560 a lot of people who've been skeptical
01:41:01.840 along the way and there's been a lot of
01:41:02.800 ups and downs but here it is I mean I
01:41:05.040 remember back in 2011 I think it's the
01:41:07.480 first time I bought a Bitcoin I think it
01:41:09.560 was at $120 now it's at
01:41:12.520 $90,000 again there have been all sorts
01:41:14.599 of wild swings along the way but this
01:41:18.199 thing just keeps keeps chugging along
01:41:20.000 and you can think of that $2 trillion
01:41:23.000 Market market cap is like a $2 trillion
01:41:25.040 bug Bounty if there was a way to hack
01:41:27.440 this there's every incentive in the
01:41:29.000 world and by hack I mean like to double
01:41:31.639 spend create basically a counterfeit
01:41:33.599 Bitcoin I guess would be the way for
01:41:34.679 people to think about it and so the
01:41:36.639 miracle it hasn't been compromised I
01:41:38.480 think we can all say that well I don't
01:41:39.840 know if it's a miracle I think it's
01:41:41.239 exceptional design sure you know and so
01:41:43.560 I think I think what you could say is
01:41:45.000 that it's been tested in a very robust
01:41:47.320 way and there's been every incentive to
01:41:48.679 basically break the encryption and it
01:41:51.599 continues to chug along and so I think
01:41:53.280 think the price has gone up as the
01:41:55.040 protocol has gotten more acceptance and
01:41:57.400 this is another point is that bitcoin's
01:41:59.920 most widely accepted as a store of value
01:42:02.360 throughout the world yeah so we do
01:42:04.599 believe it should be treated special now
01:42:06.719 that being said we're also creating the
01:42:08.080 digital asset stockpile so all the other
01:42:10.679 explain the difference between these two
01:42:12.040 so there's a digital asset stockpile
01:42:15.320 that's the Picker and then on the other
01:42:17.440 side there's a strategic reserve for
01:42:19.920 Bitcoin because we do acquire Bitcoin we
01:42:22.400 the United States of America when we
01:42:24.199 seize from terrorists you know criminals
01:42:27.159 Etc we do seize these and then we often
01:42:29.599 make the mistake of liquidating them
01:42:31.199 when maybe we should be holding them
01:42:32.280 yeah so explain that architecture so we
01:42:34.040 have the reserve and we have the
01:42:34.880 stockpile so the reserve is just Bitcoin
01:42:37.080 the goal is long-term preservation think
01:42:39.119 of it as like a digital Fort Knox for
01:42:40.840 digital gold we want to put the digital
01:42:43.480 gold in there we want to keep it secure
01:42:45.239 we never want to sell it that's the goal
01:42:46.960 of the reserve and you're right that
01:42:48.800 we've made the mistake in the past of
01:42:50.239 selling this stuff at one point in time
01:42:51.920 we had about 400,000 Bitcoin on the
01:42:53.560 federal balance sheet we sold roughly
01:42:55.800 half of that for something like $360
01:42:58.239 million total if we had held all of that
01:43:01.360 it would be worth just that the portion
01:43:02.840 we sold would be worth over 17 billion
01:43:04.960 so we made this mistake of prematurely
01:43:06.960 selling Bitcoin when we should have held
01:43:08.320 it we don't want to make that mistake
01:43:10.239 with regard to the rest of it we think
01:43:12.920 there's around 200,000 coins left on the
01:43:16.280 federal balance sheet but the truth is
01:43:18.040 that nobody knows because we've never
01:43:19.320 done a proper audit so part of what this
01:43:21.440 executive order provides is that we're
01:43:22.920 going to going to do for the first time
01:43:24.960 a government wide accounting of the
01:43:27.480 digital assets that we actually have so
01:43:29.880 and if digital assets emerge in some
01:43:32.280 Department I don't know the FBI sees a
01:43:33.840 some the CIA sees a some I don't know
01:43:35.679 which organization winds up having them
01:43:38.159 they're going to be legally required to
01:43:40.560 report that and then put in the reserve
01:43:43.239 well they'll they'll be legally required
01:43:45.040 to report it and then they'll go in the
01:43:46.360 reserve if there's a final adjudication
01:43:48.320 so you know obviously if those coins
01:43:50.800 could go back as restitution to victims
01:43:53.760 or if the person who they were seized
01:43:56.719 from wins their court case and gets them
01:43:58.800 back they're not going to go into the
01:44:00.239 Federal Reserve but if there's been a
01:44:02.000 final adjudication and a final
01:44:03.440 forfeiture yes those will go into the
01:44:05.599 reserve anyway that's Bitcoin okay so
01:44:07.719 then you got the stockpile let me just
01:44:09.080 talk about that so first of all like I
01:44:10.920 said we don't know exactly what digital
01:44:13.320 assets the federal government has I've
01:44:15.679 seen reports that it might have for
01:44:17.599 example 50,000 eth which is ethereum but
01:44:21.119 again we need to get to the bottom of
01:44:22.400 that we figure out exactly what the
01:44:24.599 assets are we're going to move them into
01:44:26.080 the digital stockpile the purpose of the
01:44:28.639 stockpile is responsible stewardship
01:44:30.560 it's a place for safekeeping it's a
01:44:33.280 centralized you could say account under
01:44:36.040 the direction of the Secretary of the
01:44:37.599 Treasury and the Secretary of the
01:44:39.520 Treasury will figure out how to maximize
01:44:41.199 the values of these Holdings now there's
01:44:43.000 a couple of important differences
01:44:44.159 between stockpile and Reserve so one is
01:44:47.520 the reserve the executive order actually
01:44:49.440 provides that the Secretary of the
01:44:50.960 Treasury will not sell the Bitcoin okay
01:44:54.239 we're we're prohibited from selling the
01:44:56.400 Bitcoin there's no such prohibition with
01:44:59.199 respect to the stock pilot if the secet
01:45:00.800 treasury decides that's in the long-term
01:45:03.280 interest of the US to rebalance the
01:45:04.760 portfolio or change the portfolio the
01:45:07.000 secretary has the discretion to do that
01:45:08.800 okay which makes sense because there's a
01:45:10.400 longtail of crypto we might see
01:45:12.000 something that we don't have the ability
01:45:13.800 to predict the predict the future and we
01:45:15.639 don't have the staff to sit there and
01:45:17.520 look at these assets every day like a
01:45:19.000 fund manager would and say huh what do
01:45:20.880 we do with these what percentage should
01:45:22.159 it be of the overall stock pot of the
01:45:23.920 overall Holdings so maybe the decision
01:45:26.440 with ethereum is hey this thing's waning
01:45:27.920 we just put it into Bitcoin because we
01:45:29.520 know that's the more solid one yeah
01:45:30.800 that's what I'm reading into it yeah I
01:45:32.000 mean I think that that's that's largely
01:45:33.599 fair I mean look I think that the
01:45:35.480 stockpile should be subject to good
01:45:37.719 portfolio management right unfortunately
01:45:40.000 we have a Secretary of the Treasury who
01:45:42.080 is an extremely successful former hedge
01:45:44.360 fund manager so he's going to figure out
01:45:46.159 the best way to manage these assets and
01:45:48.040 we give him the flexibility to do
01:45:50.080 portfolio management whereas live and
01:45:52.560 die with what he does he has to make
01:45:54.040 those decisions and and that's going to
01:45:55.480 be you know um part of how he's
01:45:57.159 evaluated by the president so hopefully
01:45:59.000 he's going to be sharp about that right
01:46:00.679 but the reserve is different right the
01:46:02.400 reserve is just digital for KNX now
01:46:04.239 there's one other important difference
01:46:05.400 between stockpile and Reserve so with
01:46:08.000 respect to to reserve the the EO
01:46:10.719 provides that the secretaries and I'm
01:46:12.320 talking about Treasury and commerce
01:46:14.199 they're allowed to figure out strategies
01:46:16.239 to accumulate more Bitcoin for the
01:46:18.400 reserve if those strategies are budget
01:46:20.159 neutral and don't cost the taxpayer
01:46:22.199 anything okay so it's possible that we
01:46:24.960 could I'm not saying that we will but it
01:46:27.119 gives them it authorizes them to acquire
01:46:29.760 more Bitcoin if they can figure out a
01:46:31.960 way to do it that doesn't impact the
01:46:35.440 federal budget or the deficit or
01:46:37.560 taxpayers right okay well I had a very
01:46:40.320 simple suggestion for this which I'll uh
01:46:42.400 float up the flag poll here and see what
01:46:44.040 you think you probably we've talked
01:46:45.280 about it on previous allins before you
01:46:47.800 on it how about a simple crypto tax you
01:46:50.080 know crypto wants to be legal you're the
01:46:51.719 crypto are
01:46:53.599 crypto wants to be regulated they want
01:46:55.639 the rules they want the rails simple
01:46:58.040 suggestion from your bestie why don't we
01:47:00.639 charge every transaction in the United
01:47:02.199 States 0.01% just about one bit in that
01:47:05.040 native currency so you want to trade
01:47:06.480 some salana for ethereum for xrp
01:47:08.760 whatever you know put in whatever names
01:47:10.320 you want there the government says hey
01:47:13.199 you want to have a a great vibrant
01:47:15.840 system here we're going to need to take
01:47:17.840 just the most modest of taxes di Minimus
01:47:20.599 in fact in the native crypto and put it
01:47:23.360 in the stockpile this seems to me like a
01:47:25.840 very that's always how tax's start is
01:47:28.080 that they're very they're described as
01:47:29.639 being very modest you know when the
01:47:30.880 income tax started it only applied to
01:47:32.520 like a thousand Americans and the
01:47:34.760 legislators swore up and down that it
01:47:36.320 would never be applied to middle class
01:47:38.239 people so I don't particularly like the
01:47:40.199 idea of new taxes even if it's it's
01:47:42.920 promised that they just won't affect
01:47:44.760 people very much that sounds burdensome
01:47:46.599 to me but look we have very successful
01:47:48.679 this would and just so you know this is
01:47:50.040 would be like more like a sales tax that
01:47:51.679 would be handled by coinbase base would
01:47:53.159 be handled by Robin Hood by would be
01:47:54.560 handled by those platforms they would
01:47:56.880 administer it it would be a
01:47:58.360 transactional tax not an income tax so
01:48:00.280 if you have a bunch it's not a wealth
01:48:01.560 tax it's not a seasoning tax but I'll
01:48:02.920 let you on it if you can convince if you
01:48:05.920 can convince the secretary of the
01:48:07.280 Commerce or the Secretary of Treasury to
01:48:09.800 run with your idea then it could
01:48:12.199 potentially happen I mean they have the
01:48:13.760 flexibility to figure out budget neutral
01:48:15.280 ways to accumulate Bitcoin I don't know
01:48:17.239 what those ways are going to be but
01:48:18.840 they're creative they're very successful
01:48:20.480 businessmen and if they figure out a way
01:48:22.800 to do this then it can be considered
01:48:24.960 that's the point okay well I'll be in
01:48:26.080 the commissary later having lunch with
01:48:27.360 you you can introduce me um so let you
01:48:29.960 let me just give you a fastball here
01:48:31.560 well we'll see if it if it gets in the
01:48:32.719 strike zone the appearance of
01:48:35.360 impropriety is what people are concerned
01:48:37.480 with the picking of winners and
01:48:39.560 losers president Trump was the crypto
01:48:42.360 president he went and he gave that
01:48:44.000 famous speech I'm G to get rid of Gary
01:48:45.679 gansler we're going to make it legal and
01:48:47.719 to his credit he has fulfilled that
01:48:49.239 promise which means hey the donor class
01:48:52.080 on that side said we're going to back
01:48:53.599 the crypto president not the anti-
01:48:55.400 crypto team which means a lot of people
01:48:58.040 who are on the Twitter and the
01:49:00.080 socials have donated a lot they have a
01:49:02.560 lot of holding so this appearance which
01:49:05.320 you've now I would give you credit have
01:49:07.800 cleaned up here hey there's two
01:49:09.199 different things going on here and we're
01:49:10.480 not using taxpayer money we get all that
01:49:13.199 but the appearance here is hey maybe
01:49:15.000 somebody's going to benefit of course
01:49:16.599 that they came after you first for that
01:49:18.480 without the facts you were very clear
01:49:20.440 you cleared all your positions you sold
01:49:22.320 everything you divested so let's make
01:49:24.280 that clear to the dumb Dums who are just
01:49:26.520 trying to say that you're personally
01:49:28.599 address that yeah please cuz this is
01:49:30.320 ridiculous yeah well people came out
01:49:32.080 right away and were saying that somehow
01:49:33.800 I was engaged in a scheme to pump my
01:49:36.480 bags or to basically create exit
01:49:38.119 liquidity for myself and and billionaire
01:49:40.040 stuff like that you have to understand
01:49:41.800 that those accusations I mean they're
01:49:43.320 accusing me of a crime and serious crime
01:49:46.639 and they're doing it with no evidence
01:49:48.000 whatsoever so these things are basically
01:49:50.400 it's moral slander slander
01:49:53.679 yeah I would say so in any event what
01:49:55.199 they didn't know and what I then
01:49:56.760 proceeded to put out there is that I
01:49:58.880 sold all my cryptocurrency prior to day
01:50:01.159 one of the administration because I
01:50:03.520 didn't want to even have the appearance
01:50:05.639 of a conflict and by the way I could
01:50:07.320 have waited I didn't have to do it like
01:50:09.599 that but I decided to do it and take it
01:50:11.320 upon myself to do that because you just
01:50:14.119 know that when it comes to crypto
01:50:15.560 there's going to be a lot of
01:50:16.239 fluctuations in the market you never
01:50:17.840 want someone to be able to point at one
01:50:19.599 of those fluctuations and say somehow
01:50:21.719 that the cryptos are benefited from that
01:50:23.440 and created a conspiracy theory which is
01:50:25.159 exactly what basically happened so first
01:50:27.159 of all I got rid of all my
01:50:28.119 cryptocurrency prior to day one craft
01:50:30.880 also sold all craft is the Venture firm
01:50:33.560 that you funded that's done a lot of
01:50:35.000 great work uh supporting Founders here
01:50:36.400 in Valley so we we basically sold I
01:50:38.520 think it was around $200 million of
01:50:40.480 crypto of which around $85 million was
01:50:43.760 personally attributable to myself and we
01:50:46.320 cleared that before day one paid taxes
01:50:48.960 on it and basically so there wouldn't be
01:50:50.719 a conflict so then the the smear shifted
01:50:53.520 in another Direction was okay well maybe
01:50:55.320 he doesn't own crypto okay but he's in
01:50:57.639 crypto funds okay and so they pointed to
01:51:00.199 you know bitwise and multi-coin capital
01:51:03.000 and I was also in blockchain capital and
01:51:05.880 so then the fund managers came out and
01:51:08.079 one by one all said actually David
01:51:10.159 called us over two months ago and said
01:51:12.040 he's going to need to divest from our
01:51:13.599 funds and so we also did that so yeah
01:51:16.480 you know I think basically they've kind
01:51:17.920 of given up on this but look it's very
01:51:19.719 easy for why let the facts get in the
01:51:21.639 way of a good ER seriously you full
01:51:24.639 disclosure you know you when you saw me
01:51:27.199 doing the sea Scouts program said hey
01:51:28.960 why don't you do a fund I'll be the
01:51:30.199 anchor I'll be your first LP and I mean
01:51:31.800 one of the most generous things you've
01:51:33.040 done in our
01:51:34.719 relationship and I had to have a call
01:51:36.840 with you you know weeks ago and say hey
01:51:39.560 okay you're going to divest okay fine no
01:51:41.159 problem no it's not not a problem for me
01:51:43.239 you sell the assets to somebody else so
01:51:44.840 the way people understand how this
01:51:45.960 mechanically works when you're in a fund
01:51:48.119 you have no sax cannot tell me what to
01:51:50.800 do in the fund he just put money in it
01:51:52.360 like I put money in other people's funds
01:51:54.119 they go and invest and 10 years later
01:51:55.880 you get a return and hopefully that
01:51:57.119 return in a venture firm or private firm
01:51:58.760 beats the markets public markets or
01:52:00.280 whatever but then you can also sell that
01:52:02.679 interest to somebody else so
01:52:04.599 mechanically takes time you have to sell
01:52:06.920 it at 50% 25% off and it's painful you
01:52:10.360 will lose I estimate you're going to
01:52:13.040 lose you know I don't want to be
01:52:14.639 gratuitous here but eight nine figures
01:52:17.320 by serving the country for a couple
01:52:18.880 years and not only that the great irony
01:52:21.199 of this is the one thing holding back
01:52:23.400 the industry is regulation
01:52:25.360 overregulation of AI and no clear
01:52:27.280 regulation in crypto you're going to fix
01:52:30.239 the two things that were number one and
01:52:32.320 two on all of our agendas in Silicon
01:52:34.239 Valley in terms of getting Returns the
01:52:36.000 next four years so the sacrifice you're
01:52:37.840 making is extraordinary and you're
01:52:40.239 making it a better environment a
01:52:42.199 regulated environment for the rest of us
01:52:43.960 to do Commerce so I just want to point
01:52:45.480 out that you're losing like double here
01:52:47.520 right well let me let me just underscore
01:52:49.320 something you said for your service and
01:52:50.840 I don't know how much they're pay how
01:52:51.880 much they paying for this job what do
01:52:53.599 you get paid like 50 Grand 100 Grand I'm
01:52:55.560 an unpaid consultant to the government
01:52:57.199 really is that actually accurate you get
01:52:58.760 no money no I don't want I don't want
01:53:00.360 any costing you money no of course it is
01:53:02.599 but it's it's it's an honor to serve and
01:53:04.800 it's a honor to be asked to serve and in
01:53:07.119 particular it's an honor to serve this
01:53:08.520 President because he really wants to
01:53:10.040 make the country great again so that's
01:53:11.440 why I'm doing it but yeah look I think
01:53:13.400 it's a it's a lazy and stupid narrative
01:53:16.239 to say that the reason why someone who's
01:53:18.400 already successful in business goes into
01:53:21.639 government is to make more money I was
01:53:23.599 making money before this involves a
01:53:25.560 substantial disruption of my business
01:53:28.400 interest and I have to devest a lot of
01:53:30.360 those business interest and in divesting
01:53:32.360 I have to be either a taxpayer or I have
01:53:34.199 to take a significant discount and it
01:53:36.000 costs you money so you know it's just a
01:53:38.800 lazy narrative that people create but
01:53:42.040 it's there's no truth to it and just to
01:53:43.320 underscore a point that that you made a
01:53:44.760 second ago you were one of the funds I
01:53:47.159 invested from not because you're a
01:53:48.599 crypto fund but because you might have a
01:53:50.760 crypto position we went through I think
01:53:52.800 the launch funds Holdings and I think
01:53:54.880 there was something crypto related in
01:53:56.520 there we have one or two that pivoted
01:53:58.800 into crypto yes right so I just didn't
01:54:00.840 want to have any problem there so listen
01:54:03.760 it's this is the nature of the politics
01:54:05.760 we have people are you know gets very
01:54:08.040 personal you know that better than
01:54:09.280 anybody and so you know that's why
01:54:11.360 you're here and hopefully we can clean
01:54:13.719 this all up and uh let people know that
01:54:16.719 hey the intent here is good so just to
01:54:18.880 go back to one other point you said
01:54:20.079 about not picking winners and losers I I
01:54:21.880 think that's a very important comment
01:54:23.560 that you made that I see as fundamental
01:54:25.199 to my job I mean look I think we do
01:54:27.079 think that Bitcoin is special for the
01:54:28.840 reasons I said beyond that we do not
01:54:31.280 want to be in the business of picking
01:54:32.560 and choosing winners in in the space and
01:54:35.960 again if some other digital asset could
01:54:38.159 prove that it's as decentralized and as
01:54:42.000 secure and as widely accepted as a store
01:54:44.639 of value as Bitcoin then maybe it could
01:54:46.800 be elevated in the same way that Bitcoin
01:54:48.760 has I mean I'm laying out the criteria
01:54:50.199 for you but look beyond that we don't
01:54:52.440 want to be picking winners and losers in
01:54:54.079 the space and that's not my job I mean
01:54:56.079 my job is not to to be a regulator or to
01:54:59.639 anoint which ones are good or bad it's
01:55:01.880 to basically be a policy adviser for
01:55:03.840 Innovation and I'll just tell you the
01:55:05.800 way that I see the you know all the
01:55:07.960 digital Assets in the space is that
01:55:09.679 what's fundamental is disclosure if
01:55:12.040 you're an issuer of a digital asset you
01:55:13.639 need to disclose you know all the
01:55:15.920 material facts about what you're doing
01:55:17.920 and those facts have to be accurate you
01:55:19.480 can't lie my view is that if you if you
01:55:22.480 the issuer lie about something the
01:55:24.760 government should come down on you like
01:55:25.840 a ton of bricks because that's fraud
01:55:27.840 okay but as long as you do this in an
01:55:29.840 honest way people should be able to
01:55:31.560 trade these things I understand that you
01:55:33.679 think a lot of them are garbage you
01:55:35.199 might be right you could express that
01:55:37.320 view in a trade but as long as everyone
01:55:39.840 has been above board in terms of
01:55:41.679 disclosure people should have the right
01:55:43.480 to trade these things and some are going
01:55:44.840 to make money some are going to lose
01:55:45.960 money it's about the freedom to
01:55:48.360 basically to trade to hold these assets
01:55:50.400 the government doesn't want to get in
01:55:51.280 the way of that it's just wants to make
01:55:52.920 sure that the information is out there
01:55:55.199 that it's honest and if people lie in
01:55:57.599 order to profit I'm all in favor of
01:55:59.679 going after them well and you know we
01:56:01.560 already have a regulated market as an
01:56:03.719 analogy and when you tell a lie and you
01:56:06.960 sell a share in a company whether it's a
01:56:08.480 private or a public company the SEC has
01:56:10.560 a term for that it's called Securities
01:56:11.800 fraud and we you know have this new type
01:56:14.560 of device it's very Innovative it could
01:56:17.280 be an nft it could be a trading card it
01:56:19.400 could be an actual utility token where
01:56:21.119 you burn it in use of a service or it
01:56:23.639 could be anything it could be whatever
01:56:25.800 the person describes it as but what's
01:56:28.000 important is there's an entity with a
01:56:30.280 group of people I think you would agree
01:56:32.440 who have said we have ownership of this
01:56:34.280 we're Incorporated here in the United
01:56:36.040 States not in Panama not in the BVI not
01:56:39.239 in some you know other place where maybe
01:56:41.800 they're a little faster or looser with
01:56:43.840 regulations you got to be here in the US
01:56:45.960 maybe you have to be insured in some way
01:56:47.960 maybe there has to be a board like there
01:56:49.679 does in Delaware or in an LLC there has
01:56:51.719 to be some person where the buck stops
01:56:54.320 and if you lie while committing a
01:56:56.719 transaction or taking money for an asset
01:56:59.760 it would be Securities fraud and yes
01:57:01.599 people will come down on you like a ton
01:57:03.119 of bricks and if you promote things and
01:57:05.239 you don't disclose it well we have rules
01:57:07.280 about that as well we saw many
01:57:08.520 celebrities get pinched last time uh for
01:57:12.679 tweeting about cryptocurrencies and this
01:57:15.000 is the stuff that I think has to stop I
01:57:17.639 think it should feel more like what we
01:57:19.040 do in Angel Investing the private
01:57:20.560 companies and in public companies so
01:57:22.400 that's your job when are we going to see
01:57:25.159 you know that framework emerge because
01:57:26.960 here you're only like 40 50 days into
01:57:28.760 this I think when we see the actual
01:57:31.639 bones of a framework so if I want to do
01:57:34.679 jco and I want to make an Angel
01:57:36.639 Investing coin or I want to do something
01:57:38.480 fun an nft collection for Allin or
01:57:40.840 something when will we have the actual
01:57:42.760 rules of the road and that and that's
01:57:44.840 going to be multiple agencies right yeah
01:57:46.599 what you're describing is is known in
01:57:48.840 Washington or that the the um the area
01:57:51.400 of policy that you're describing is
01:57:52.960 known as Market structure and Market
01:57:54.679 structure is about providing a clear
01:57:56.360 framework for Market participants it
01:57:58.480 would Define what is the security what's
01:58:00.320 a commodity what's simply a collectible
01:58:03.400 you know it's property but it's not a
01:58:05.320 security and then what are the rules for
01:58:07.119 each category that's know as Market
01:58:08.599 structure there is a bill that passed
01:58:10.840 the last Congress in the house but Biden
01:58:13.760 basically he didn't veto it but he
01:58:15.639 basically he and the Democrats stopped
01:58:17.960 he stopped in the Senate the Democrats
01:58:19.480 did it was called
01:58:20.880 fit21 and it was authored by french hill
01:58:24.000 who's now the chairman of the house
01:58:26.199 Financial Services committee so we
01:58:28.159 expect that he will be introducing a new
01:58:29.880 version of his bill probably in the next
01:58:32.560 few weeks I don't think I'm breaking any
01:58:34.199 news by saying this I think people
01:58:36.000 expect it and that's going to provide
01:58:37.920 the framework for Market structure and
01:58:40.119 it's going to provide a lot of the
01:58:40.960 definitions that that you're talking
01:58:42.440 about now I I agree with your sentiment
01:58:45.800 okay but I will say that I might have a
01:58:48.280 different view than you of what is the
01:58:49.880 security what's not I mean to me
01:58:51.599 collectible are not Securities but if
01:58:54.239 it's a collectible you got to disclaim
01:58:56.520 that look this has no intrinsic value
01:58:59.000 right that's a collectible think about a
01:59:00.400 baseball card a baseball card is a piece
01:59:02.560 of cardboard it has no intrinsic value
01:59:04.599 but the value comes from basically other
01:59:06.920 collectors being willing to buy it from
01:59:08.800 you and you could just say that that's
01:59:10.280 irrational whatever but so look I think
01:59:12.400 as long as people disclaim that this
01:59:15.159 coin has no intrinsic value they should
01:59:17.840 be able to issue meme coins it's a
01:59:19.719 separate question why people would want
01:59:21.719 to buy them but look that's very in my
01:59:24.159 view that's very different than someone
01:59:25.840 who goes out as an issuer and says I'm
01:59:28.400 issuing a token or a coin that has lots
01:59:31.159 of functionality and has lots of value
01:59:33.960 and you'll hear some of these guys even
01:59:35.599 say that hey our token is more valuable
01:59:38.280 than Bitcoin you should value it more
01:59:39.800 highly well if you're promising that and
01:59:42.320 you're saying that it's going to have
01:59:43.239 certain functionality you better be
01:59:44.800 telling the truth about it then we start
01:59:46.520 getting into the how we test and people
01:59:48.360 can go look that up if they if they want
01:59:50.119 what I will say is there's an
01:59:51.560 educational process that has to come in
01:59:53.520 here which we've gone through as the
01:59:55.119 United States when people would buy
01:59:56.400 interest in mines people would buy
01:59:58.280 interest in gold claims oil fields and
02:00:00.960 that's when a lot of these regulations
02:00:02.320 came out in the 20s around accreditation
02:00:05.079 we've spoke about this before it's a pet
02:00:06.400 peeve of mind but I think there should
02:00:07.520 be an educational framework here and I
02:00:09.599 think there should also be some Nuance
02:00:11.320 that you could work on specifically with
02:00:13.440 this group of being clear that when you
02:00:16.920 have a ticker symbol associated with
02:00:19.000 something or you do charts associated
02:00:21.239 with something you know it starts to
02:00:23.119 smell like a duck it looks like a duck
02:00:24.840 it's quacking like a duck but then in
02:00:26.560 the terms of services say hey this is a
02:00:28.159 collectible I think there needs to be
02:00:29.760 some ground rules which maybe it says
02:00:31.760 hey these need to be presented in a
02:00:34.000 certain way at the top level so the
02:00:37.000 Nuance of disclosure is so important
02:00:39.199 when I tweet something if it was an
02:00:41.520 Advertiser or a sponsor of Allin or this
02:00:43.679 week in startups or any influencer or
02:00:45.840 you did would to do this and you said I
02:00:48.239 love you know this brand you and I both
02:00:51.000 were well you were an investor in ATM if
02:00:53.880 we were to tweet about that as investors
02:00:56.280 we don't have to disclose but if we were
02:00:57.880 paid for that the FTC has rules you have
02:01:00.360 to put this is a paid partnership you
02:01:02.199 cannot confuse consumers and I think
02:01:04.840 that's where you're going to have to do
02:01:05.840 a little bit of cleanup work and
02:01:07.520 structure as well is the disclosure and
02:01:09.679 how this appears and then also maybe the
02:01:13.800 educational system so you know if you
02:01:15.960 want to own a firearm if you want to
02:01:17.199 drive a car if you want to be you know a
02:01:19.679 beautician and listen we can talk about
02:01:21.119 overregulation you got to take tests man
02:01:23.920 it would just be so much better if
02:01:25.280 consumers could take you know like a 50
02:01:27.719 question test just to say hey they
02:01:30.159 understand what we're talking about here
02:01:32.119 in in terms of diversification so they
02:01:33.880 don't yo YOLO their entire mortgage and
02:01:36.199 house into one crypto so what are your
02:01:38.760 thoughts on those two issues disclosures
02:01:40.880 how it's presented and then
02:01:42.400 accreditation and maybe a path to
02:01:43.920 accreditation sophisticated investor
02:01:45.440 tells us how I refer to it for all
02:01:47.320 Americans because 90% of people can't
02:01:49.360 participate in private companies your
02:01:51.520 thoughts well disclosure is the key like
02:01:53.800 I said I mean these projects should have
02:01:55.480 to disclose certain things I think for
02:01:57.320 example the token cap table should be
02:01:59.360 disclosed who are the who are the
02:02:01.040 Insiders how much do they have when are
02:02:03.199 they selling you know that's that's
02:02:05.360 information the market should always
02:02:06.840 know in my opinion easily done with the
02:02:08.960 technology lotted by the crypto
02:02:10.880 Community the blockchain this could just
02:02:12.599 be on the blockchain this was always the
02:02:14.000 problem we had as Venture capitalists
02:02:15.960 with hey this is a token project who
02:02:17.920 owns the tokens where are they when can
02:02:20.239 when can I sell when can you sell
02:02:21.920 insiders yes yeah I don't think you have
02:02:23.360 to disclose everyone who owns a token
02:02:25.000 that could be hard to comply with but I
02:02:26.520 think you should have to dis you should
02:02:28.360 have to disclose the Insiders and their
02:02:30.760 their sales plans and their lockups and
02:02:33.119 and and I would also say how new tokens
02:02:35.000 get created I mean if this is a fully
02:02:37.920 centralized token where they can dism
02:02:40.119 more people need to know that because
02:02:41.960 there's no scarcity right but if there's
02:02:44.360 somehow an enforcement mechanism and
02:02:46.679 there's enforced scarcity then that's a
02:02:48.560 different story so yeah these things
02:02:50.599 have to be disclosed and by the way I
02:02:52.040 think the market structure bills will do
02:02:54.040 that there's a version of this in fit 21
02:02:56.360 last Congress I think it'll be the next
02:02:57.840 one and moreover the SEC is looking
02:03:00.199 right now at these rules and they're
02:03:01.520 going to create their own Frameworks
02:03:03.679 they're doing an exent J SEC Chief I I
02:03:06.440 was doing some research on him he's a
02:03:08.560 really Pro actually more Americans being
02:03:11.079 able to invest in privates private
02:03:12.599 Equity Etc and he's given speeches on it
02:03:14.840 in the past so the person who's been
02:03:16.079 nominated for the new chair of the SEC
02:03:17.920 his named Paul Atkins and he he has not
02:03:19.599 been confirmed yet the confirmation
02:03:20.800 hearing still need to happen
02:03:22.679 separately Hester Pur who's a
02:03:24.560 commissioner at the SEC is in charge of
02:03:26.639 I know Hester I've had her on uh this
02:03:28.079 week in startups a couple times she's
02:03:29.360 great she's excellent she's very well
02:03:31.079 informed and she's T very sharp taking
02:03:33.400 the lead on all the crypto related stuff
02:03:35.159 so I trust her and I trust the SEC to
02:03:37.880 produce those detailed Frameworks that
02:03:40.079 you're talking about yeah I think that
02:03:43.119 my role as call it Innovation policy
02:03:44.920 adviser is just to kind of make sure
02:03:46.280 that we have the big picture right and
02:03:48.520 I'm I'm very confident that the SEC the
02:03:50.400 cftc and the legis they're going to
02:03:52.280 figure out the balance here sex you got
02:03:53.760 to go really proud of the work here uh
02:03:56.840 congratulations on cleaning this all up
02:03:58.880 and presenting a really thoughtful plan
02:04:01.079 that we can all ask you hard questions
02:04:03.079 on appreciate you taking the hard
02:04:04.440 questions here on uh the all podcast um
02:04:07.679 and good luck when you do the rest of
02:04:09.280 the media circus uh I wonder if I'm
02:04:11.880 going to be the hardest questioner of
02:04:13.119 you I I hope so and uh for people asking
02:04:15.599 yes I'm wearing a suit because I am now
02:04:18.440 joining the administration big
02:04:19.960 announcement I'm the official podcast

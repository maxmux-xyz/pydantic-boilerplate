00:01:55.640 what's awesome is a lot of the
00:01:57.600 recommendations he shared is becoming
00:02:00.240 policy it seems for the Trump
00:02:01.560 Administration
00:02:03.119 Elon and bessent and others in the
00:02:06.600 administration have echoed trying to get
00:02:08.800 government deficit below 3% of GDP that
00:02:11.520 seems to be the economic magical number
00:02:14.160 and if you can do that rates drop I
00:02:15.720 think that's resonated it was great to

00:03:11.920 are 17 days into the Trump 2.0
00:03:14.840 presidency and seems like the main
00:03:17.480 character gentleman is Doge the
00:03:19.319 department of government
00:03:21.000 efficiency and uh they seem to have
00:03:23.640 found a little known agency us a let's
00:03:27.440 unpack it and talk about us Aid and Doge
00:03:30.680 maybe in three acts the first one let me
00:03:33.400 just uh educate the audience on what US
00:03:35.879 Aid is and then get y'all's General
00:03:38.200 reaction to it most Americans probably
00:03:40.680 haven't heard of us Aid it stands for
00:03:43.040 the United States agency for
00:03:44.680 International Development was
00:03:46.439 established by JFK by an executive order
00:03:48.640 back in 1961 Wall Street Journal summed
00:03:51.000 up its purpose as quote make friends and
00:03:53.439 influence countries in the American
00:03:55.120 interest according to the US gov website
00:03:58.000 the purpose of us Aid is to extend
00:04:00.599 assistance to countries recovering from
00:04:02.959 disaster got a budget of about $45
00:04:05.319 billion a year under Biden and uh that's
00:04:08.680 about 150 bucks per American per year
00:04:11.360 they have at least 10,000 employees or
00:04:13.720 did and as of 2023 they had programs in
00:04:16.918 130 countries obviously there's 195
00:04:19.959 countries in the
00:04:21.320 world and uh the budget doubled under
00:04:24.560 Biden from 26 to 45 the budget was
00:04:27.080 between 15 and 20 billion during Trump's
00:04:30.280 first
00:04:31.600 term but the White House and uh I guess
00:04:34.680 Elon and the Doge team found out about
00:04:38.759 this us aid went in there and found all
00:04:41.199 kinds of interesting spend $2.5 million
00:04:44.479 to fund EV charging station in Vietnam 2
00:04:47.720 million for sex changes in
00:04:49.880 lgbtq activism in Guatemala 1.5 million
00:04:53.080 to a Serbian lgbtq group 70k for a Dei
00:04:57.800 musical 47k for a trans gender Opera in
00:05:00.840 Columbia uh the Dei musical by the way
00:05:03.320 is in Ireland so if you get if you you
00:05:05.400 make it to Galloway you can see that Dei
00:05:07.280 musical this went on and on and it has
00:05:10.840 become quite a
00:05:12.960 story Antonio you're our guest here this
00:05:15.720 week you and I and saxs and Elon spent a
00:05:19.360 little time at Twitter during the
00:05:21.280 Takeover where I think a lot of these
00:05:23.919 techniques were first put into action
00:05:27.000 your thoughts on what's happening with
00:05:28.600 Doge
00:05:30.560 I mean look Jason first want to thank
00:05:32.000 you guys for having me um it's great to
00:05:33.360 see
00:05:34.360 everyone you g see the musical I like to
00:05:37.639 see music no I booked it we're all going
00:05:39.280 to the what is it
00:05:41.960 called is there actually a name of the
00:05:44.680 musical yeah it's Dei comma the
00:05:48.560 musical oh man it's a heartwarming story
00:05:51.880 I apologize getting a job sorry guys
00:05:54.479 you're not qualified for I apologize
00:05:56.520 yeah so I I think the I think the Doge
00:05:58.759 uh story Maybe starts with the Twitter
00:06:00.479 takeover yeah right so Twitter was
00:06:03.199 spewing the woke mind virus in the world
00:06:05.600 which is why you did it to begin with
00:06:08.120 and you know when we got there as you
00:06:09.319 know it was uh basically breaking even
00:06:11.080 and there's there was going to be 12 and
00:06:13.080 halfish billion dollars a 10 of the
00:06:14.080 company so a billion half dollar in
00:06:15.880 interest costs that there was no money
00:06:17.280 to pay um which led to the turnaround I
00:06:19.360 think which was the biggest turnaround
00:06:20.880 like of all time literally the biggest
00:06:22.720 turnaround I think ever in history
00:06:24.120 second biggest Tech deal ever
00:06:25.919 done 80% of the people gone that doesn't
00:06:29.080 include all the contractors that were
00:06:30.240 there and you know the company's now
00:06:31.960 servicing its debt and they just priced
00:06:34.680 yesterday their one of their Bank deals
00:06:37.080 at 97 cents so this is a huge win means
00:06:40.880 the company's doing extremely well other
00:06:42.520 people bought the bank debt and that
00:06:44.639 then the bank debt traded up to a little
00:06:46.360 over 98 so 98 and 58 you know a giant
00:06:50.080 business success a rousing business
00:06:51.319 success and Jason you were there for
00:06:53.039 part of it you saw it it was a disaster
00:06:55.160 U this place was you know it was tampons
00:06:57.360 in the bathrooms and every woke thing
00:06:58.479 you could possibly imagine and no one in
00:06:59.720 the office uh that the it was so bad
00:07:01.800 that the pens had gone dry in the
00:07:03.440 conference rooms which is is incredible
00:07:05.800 and I think that you know that's how the
00:07:07.560 so you mean the pens had gone dry
00:07:08.919 because they were never being used or
00:07:10.240 because they were being used so much
00:07:11.800 they were never been used we got there
00:07:13.440 on the yeah the Halloween weekend and we
00:07:16.280 started whiteboarding and you know
00:07:20.000 no next 10 no ink yeah I mean everything
00:07:23.479 it was it's incredible and but but uh
00:07:26.080 flowers were impeccable food being made
00:07:28.000 fresh every day for thousands of people
00:07:29.520 and thrown away um three times a day
00:07:31.759 toss in the garbage we didn't give it to
00:07:33.039 the homeless it was just it was
00:07:34.680 shockingly bad bureaucracy gone mad bad
00:07:37.759 Inc is people don't care so it was both
00:07:41.360 I think this turned into two things one
00:07:42.759 was just stop the W mine virus you know
00:07:44.479 the interesting thing is U the the they
00:07:46.919 do external brand safety checks there
00:07:48.319 now and they have 99% rating in brand
00:07:50.000 safety U now right so stock the wus
00:07:53.440 going in the world number one number two
00:07:54.879 fix the company and both have happened
00:07:57.000 it's been a couple years now right three
00:07:58.319 years now and both have happened
00:08:00.080 um not even three years two and a half
00:08:01.199 years really and both have happened and
00:08:02.840 I think you take that that that was sort
00:08:04.240 of the warm-up act for what's going on
00:08:06.080 at Doge which is you know the president
00:08:08.120 United States um president Trump wants
00:08:10.360 to make America great again and that I
00:08:12.120 think begins with making the government
00:08:13.360 great and you got to fix it it's a
00:08:15.039 turnaround this is the biggest
00:08:16.319 turnaround of all time and president
00:08:18.280 Trump has the uh courage to do it and
00:08:20.479 he's got a great Ally in Elon to make it
00:08:22.039 happen in Doge and so the numbers are
00:08:24.319 pretty easy right um we're spending uh 6
00:08:27.360 and half trillion we bring in 4 and half
00:08:29.159 trillion we got to find $2 trillion
00:08:31.120 somewhere interest cost a trillion doll
00:08:32.519 a year the bond markets were going up
00:08:34.679 the the long Bond was going up a lot
00:08:36.039 because people did believe that we
00:08:37.120 couldn't stop spending creating
00:08:38.080 inflation you see those trading down now
00:08:40.200 as doge is starting to take effect
00:08:41.640 people see it's real the stuff you're
00:08:42.760 talking about it's sort it's sort of
00:08:44.399 extraordinary what's happening and the
00:08:46.399 you know El said this public right fraud
00:08:48.240 waste and abuse he think it's kind of
00:08:49.880 10% of the budget is probably fraud I
00:08:52.399 think it might be low actually so you're
00:08:55.120 talking about you know 6 650 billion a
00:08:57.760 trillion in waste I think that's
00:08:59.040 probably about right that alone fixes
00:09:00.680 the problem but really serious about it
00:09:02.600 Jason for me and what scared me when I
00:09:04.800 when we first started thinking about
00:09:06.000 this look and I'm not there full-time
00:09:07.800 you know I'm uh in and out a little bit
00:09:09.680 and and trying to help where I can but
00:09:10.720 I'm not there fulltime um when I thought
00:09:13.560 when this started I thought we had a
00:09:14.680 democracy that it turned into
00:09:15.920 bureaucracy
00:09:17.720 okay what I'm afraid of now is we have a
00:09:21.279 bureaucracy that is about to turn into a
00:09:24.079 kleptocracy I mean a Latin American
00:09:26.040 style kleptocracy okay the stuff you're
00:09:27.680 talking about that is pure fraud and
00:09:30.480 you're make making some jokes out of it
00:09:31.920 the DI musical but if you go into the
00:09:33.720 data that's coming out of usid what you
00:09:35.440 find is you know there's a lot of
00:09:37.360 political contributions going on their
00:09:38.440 Politico itself being funded by usaid I
00:09:41.640 mean that is pure corruption that's like
00:09:43.200 a lad style autocracy and we cannot let
00:09:46.399 it go there I mean I think we I think
00:09:48.160 this happened just in a good time and
00:09:49.839 I'm super grateful to all the people
00:09:51.320 there there's you know 80 plus people
00:09:53.040 there all Patriots gone full-time okay
00:09:55.279 so chamath you've been watching this you
00:09:57.240 hear from Antonio what's your general
00:09:59.560 take on what we saw in the first I don't
00:10:02.720 know 20 days of
00:10:04.600 Doge or no 15 days sorry it's 15 days of
00:10:07.760 Doge so let me try to give you a little
00:10:10.959 bit of historical context because I
00:10:12.880 think that that's important I think
00:10:15.480 whenever I hear so many people
00:10:17.399 breathlessly saying some version of
00:10:21.240 WTF as if this is totally new it's not
00:10:25.240 new and I'll give you two examples but
00:10:28.279 one that I really want to double click
00:10:29.760 on the two examples I'll give you is
00:10:32.120 that in
00:10:33.640 1941 The Truman committee was formed
00:10:38.240 because there was a fear that the
00:10:41.160 spending by the defense department was
00:10:45.120 completely out of
00:10:46.760 whack and over the next six or seven
00:10:49.639 years and this is really what gave
00:10:51.920 Truman The credibility to them become
00:10:53.639 Roosevelt's vice president was they
00:10:56.680 found incredible levels of waste Fraud
00:11:00.320 and Abuse during the war before the war
00:11:03.160 effort and then after Pearl Harbor
00:11:05.519 during the war process over seven years
00:11:09.000 that committee and this is in$
00:11:12.639 1941 they were tasked and budgeted with
00:11:15.519 only 20 or
00:11:17.519 $30,000 okay over the next six years
00:11:19.920 they spent less than a million inflation
00:11:22.279 adjusted to 2023 this is where I found
00:11:25.399 the data was about 65 million they spent
00:11:28.440 you know how much they SA
00:11:30.600 it's estimated they saved somewhere
00:11:32.399 between1 to 15 billion in
00:11:36.480 1941 that's a quarter of a trillion
00:11:40.839 2023 the second example is we did this
00:11:44.800 under President Clinton and that was
00:11:46.440 called the National Partnership for
00:11:48.760 Reinventing government so the first
00:11:51.839 thing that I think it's important to
00:11:53.320 acknowledge is this is not new we've
00:11:56.000 done Doge twice before both have been
00:11:59.600 successful the Harry Truman one was
00:12:01.680 incredibly important because it really
00:12:03.760 set guardrails for how this can be done
00:12:06.519 everything in that committee it was a
00:12:07.880 senate committee was unanimous so it was
00:12:10.279 Republicans and Democrats that found
00:12:12.360 waste Fraud and Abuse everywhere they
00:12:15.440 saved an enormous amount of
00:12:17.360 money the second which is interesting is
00:12:20.000 these last two versions of Doge were
00:12:22.560 driven and led by democrats the same
00:12:24.800 people today who are basically saying
00:12:27.160 hey hold on a second we have congression
00:12:29.440 committees or we have inspector
00:12:32.240 generals and they lack the awareness to
00:12:35.199 know that their own party was the
00:12:37.160 driving force for this two times before
00:12:40.360 and I think it's important to just
00:12:42.440 acknowledge that those methods are not
00:12:44.760 good anymore right because I think what
00:12:47.000 we're finding early days is the rot is
00:12:49.120 super pervasive there's no
00:12:52.120 accountability and so I think you need
00:12:53.959 people to look at it with fresh eyes and
00:12:56.040 what is Doge at the end of the day what
00:12:57.680 they are are read only Auditors of the
00:13:00.800 truth and the press secretary in the
00:13:03.399 White House made this very clear it's
00:13:05.880 incredible the power that readon access
00:13:08.839 gives you all it allows you to do is
00:13:10.959 just take the data and present the data
00:13:13.800 they can't manipulate it and what
00:13:15.639 they're able to do is publish all of
00:13:17.079 this stuff in real time and that's why
00:13:18.920 this is so important because if it went
00:13:20.519 into a congressional committee to be
00:13:22.880 honest with you it would sit there and
00:13:26.600 stew for six seven eight nine months you
00:13:29.560 would maybe get small little tidbits of
00:13:31.519 it but now instead you're just getting
00:13:33.079 the full thrust of it and what is the
00:13:35.680 biggest thing that I find concerning I
00:13:39.720 think it's what Antonio said which is
00:13:41.680 that the
00:13:43.800 media who are supposed to be this
00:13:46.240 intermediary layer that's totally
00:13:49.279 objective between the government and the
00:13:52.079 people were not independent at all but
00:13:55.600 had all kinds of hidden incentives $8
00:13:57.680 million to politicos several million
00:13:59.759 dollars to the BBC I think it's
00:14:02.240 important to ask what's going on and by
00:14:04.160 the way that also has historical context
00:14:08.000 this is exactly what happened in the 60s
00:14:10.079 and 70s where it turned out that record
00:14:13.759 companies were paying DJs to pay songs
00:14:16.680 there was a huge set of lawsuits and
00:14:19.240 trial cases and the result was a change
00:14:21.480 in the law right and we call that Peola
00:14:24.240 now which is you cannot take this money
00:14:25.880 without disclosing it and so had this
00:14:28.320 money been absorbed these
00:14:30.360 entities and actually disclosed maybe
00:14:32.720 we'd be okay but Nick I sent you a link
00:14:34.519 maybe you can throw it on the screen for
00:14:35.839 these guys it's is a very simple
00:14:37.839 manifestation of this cycle we talked
00:14:40.720 about this guys and we didn't realize
00:14:44.000 how connected it all was but we were
00:14:46.680 asking ourselves during the election
00:14:48.120 cycle last year why are all these
00:14:49.600 articles buried why aren't we really
00:14:51.399 getting the truth and it turns out that
00:14:53.680 the people who were responsible for
00:14:55.320 telling the truth somewhere along the
00:14:58.040 chain were koled or just told not to
00:15:00.320 tell the truth influenced by all of this
00:15:03.240 back Channel money that was going back
00:15:04.720 and forth from the government to these
00:15:06.120 folks okay yeah let me just give some
00:15:09.000 numbers to uh what you were referencing
00:15:11.959 there the US Aid organization has been
00:15:16.079 giving money uh as have other agencies
00:15:19.079 to journals databases and subscriptions
00:15:22.279 there's probably some amount of that
00:15:23.800 that makes sense however when we look at
00:15:26.519 this during Trump 1 spend on political
00:15:29.000 was averaging around 1.3 million a year
00:15:31.199 but it suddenly ballooned up to 8
00:15:32.800 million a year under Biden and you can
00:15:34.680 see the quarterly payments here on this
00:15:36.959 chart so there's some normal amount to
00:15:39.360 spend on Publications or for a library
00:15:42.680 at an organization and so what we're
00:15:44.519 looking here is all federal agencies and
00:15:47.360 suddenly during Biden there is a very
00:15:49.800 suspicious ramp up in spend to Politico
00:15:53.079 all of this is breaking a lot of this
00:15:54.639 hasn't been verified yet so we'll we'll
00:15:57.199 put that caveat on it
00:15:59.800 and then there is a number of 34 million
00:16:02.360 that's been floating around that's all
00:16:04.160 years back to 2008 not just 2024 less
00:16:07.560 people have that
00:16:09.519 number ju supposed or or or um
00:16:13.639 misattributed when political was
00:16:15.319 acquired back in 2021 they were doing
00:16:16.880 about 200 million in Revenue so this
00:16:19.560 would be about 4% of their revenue it's
00:16:21.600 pretty significant the BBC also received
00:16:23.920 2.7 million in funding from us Aid in
00:16:26.759 2023 that was 8% of their annual income
00:16:29.720 that's a little suspicious Thompson
00:16:32.079 Reuters which is the Consulting arm of
00:16:34.399 Reuters they've received 120 million
00:16:37.079 dollar from the federal government since
00:16:38.639 2011 that's got to be looked at and
00:16:40.360 double clicked on and uh half of that
00:16:42.880 came during the Biden Administration New
00:16:44.680 York
00:16:45.680 Times hasn't actually received all that
00:16:48.040 much 370k from the federal government
00:16:49.839 last year under Biden it went from 100K
00:16:51.959 a year to like 300 so the the New York
00:16:54.120 Times data has been cleaned up a little
00:16:56.920 bit all of this is to say
00:16:59.440 there's spending going on with the press
00:17:02.040 that certainly doesn't look good and
00:17:03.680 should be verified and challenged
00:17:07.359 obviously and we are in a breaking news
00:17:09.039 environment so we'll see how that
00:17:11.640 information shakes out over time which
00:17:14.559 is one of the great things I think about
00:17:16.400 Doge is they're getting this information
00:17:18.039 out there and citizen journalists are uh
00:17:20.520 looking at public databases freedberg
00:17:23.160 and uh we're having a conversation about
00:17:25.199 this a conversation two years ago
00:17:26.679 freedberg when you kept harping on every
00:17:29.360 episode about our debt and uh you know
00:17:31.919 about the interest payments two or three
00:17:33.559 years ago you were way ahead of the
00:17:35.280 curve and now here we are we didn't
00:17:38.160 think anybody would ever take this cause
00:17:39.799 up and now it is the cause of the moment
00:17:42.799 what are your thoughts on the first two
00:17:44.640 weeks of Doge Friedberg magnificent okay
00:17:48.919 magnificent I mean what else is there to
00:17:50.960 say emoi yeah this is the eggplant Emoji
00:17:54.160 it's what we needed if you zoom out on
00:17:55.960 what doge is doing I think the best way
00:17:57.720 to describe it is zero BAS budgeting and
00:18:00.280 in organizations that go through zerob
00:18:02.000 based budgeting you do a cycle typically
00:18:03.799 annually where you take all of your
00:18:05.640 opacs all of your expenses and running a
00:18:07.520 company or running an organization down
00:18:09.120 to the studs you take it down to zero
00:18:11.120 and you rebuild it up and you say what
00:18:12.520 are we trying to achieve this year from
00:18:13.880 first principles based on that set of
00:18:16.039 objectives those goals what do we need
00:18:17.520 to do what's the minimal expense we need
00:18:19.640 to run you don't start with last year's
00:18:21.760 numbers and say what else do we need to
00:18:23.400 do and start to add on top of that you
00:18:24.880 really do a hard level high degree of
00:18:26.919 scrutiny on every dollar move out and
00:18:29.360 that's what doge is effectively doing
00:18:30.760 they're doing a zero based budgeting on
00:18:32.840 the federal government they're looking
00:18:34.440 at every line item and they're asking
00:18:35.919 the fundamental question which I don't
00:18:37.520 think we talk about in the public
00:18:39.280 discourse enough which is what is the
00:18:41.280 essential role of government and there
00:18:43.799 is a great debate to be had around that
00:18:45.760 point should government be providing
00:18:48.280 humanitarian Aid in international
00:18:50.480 markets that's a good debate to be had
00:18:53.039 should the government be providing
00:18:54.640 security to Nations that can't provide
00:18:56.480 security for themselves does the US
00:18:58.440 government have a role in that should
00:18:59.720 the government be providing loans for
00:19:01.360 people to go to sh universities should
00:19:03.360 the government be providing loans for
00:19:04.880 people to buy homes that are overpriced
00:19:07.360 etc etc etc and as we start to ask the
00:19:10.520 questions of how we're spending money I
00:19:12.080 think it ends up leading to the most
00:19:13.640 important questions which is what is the
00:19:15.600 essential role of government which I
00:19:17.640 think is the debate that needs to be had
00:19:19.240 in order for the Democracy to last so
00:19:21.559 I'm very happy to see the effort of Doge
00:19:23.440 and I think that it's the beginning of
00:19:24.720 what I hope will be kind of a long-term
00:19:26.320 process of asking the fundamental
00:19:28.200 questions about essential government and
00:19:30.760 and Antonio zerob based budgeting was
00:19:32.559 the first thing you sort of introduced
00:19:35.440 when the Twitter takeover happened just
00:19:38.159 what do we need in terms of design what
00:19:39.640 does the sales team need to hit these
00:19:41.280 sales numbers how many servers do we
00:19:43.480 need and my Lord the waste Fraud and
00:19:47.120 Abuse at that company was shocking they
00:19:50.440 had buildings that were $100 a square
00:19:53.280 foot if I remember correctly that were
00:19:55.280 used for storage of the furniture from
00:19:58.080 the previous building that had been
00:19:59.799 upgraded and were storing them in class
00:20:02.480 A office space you reference the
00:20:06.720 commissary 20 people were having lunch a
00:20:09.159 day but they had never ratcheted down
00:20:12.159 the amount of food they were making so
00:20:13.640 each meal was about $800 on average when
00:20:16.600 you when you did the math for those 20
00:20:18.799 meals just in the San Francisco office
00:20:21.039 maybe you could talk a little bit about
00:20:23.799 how the the shock and awe
00:20:26.720 campaign of just freezing spending and
00:20:29.640 then seeing hey what actually is
00:20:32.840 necessary to accomplish this task worked
00:20:35.799 out at at Twitter and then how you see
00:20:37.799 that being executed uh you know inside
00:20:40.480 of our
00:20:41.880 government yeah thanks Jason it was I
00:20:43.720 was pretty extraordinary actually the um
00:20:46.280 you know the Twitter experience the
00:20:47.400 first thing you do in a turn like that
00:20:48.400 is try and get the checkbook and just
00:20:49.679 turn payments off and then see what
00:20:51.559 happens because there are lot of people
00:20:53.120 that shouldn't be getting paid and
00:20:55.080 sometimes they complain and sometimes
00:20:56.120 you find the people that complain the
00:20:57.200 loudest are the ones who are could in
00:20:58.799 the worst fraud they're the worst
00:21:00.200 frauders in the whole in the whole game
00:21:01.520 right the worst grifters are the ones
00:21:02.559 who are saying they're crying uh the
00:21:05.039 most Amar of foul and the problem at
00:21:08.000 least in Twitter there were financial
00:21:10.039 statements like we could actually there
00:21:11.559 was an audit financial statement and
00:21:12.720 they were basically you know they were't
00:21:14.600 some ways correct I would say uh there
00:21:16.760 were some issues with the with the user
00:21:18.240 growth Dows Etc the incen plans but the
00:21:20.600 actual like you know the cash FL numbers
00:21:21.919 were pretty much correct here the
00:21:23.840 problem is much much deeper and it makes
00:21:26.960 this zero based budgeting question much
00:21:28.799 harder which is the way the government
00:21:31.320 works uh a department just basically
00:21:33.919 asks for money from Treasury and they
00:21:35.320 send it out we all run businesses
00:21:37.720 there's a Reconciliation process you you
00:21:39.760 have a contract you isue a PO against it
00:21:42.600 something comes in you check that it
00:21:44.279 came in Services is rendered and then
00:21:46.600 you issue a payable and then you know
00:21:48.400 some a month later you pay it right that
00:21:50.400 doesn't happen to the US government
00:21:51.799 there is that that process is broken it
00:21:53.720 used to happen it's broken now and so
00:21:56.240 literally money is Flowing out I used to
00:21:58.039 ask myself question why are the numbers
00:22:00.320 always revised why are they always wrong
00:22:01.720 how can the government know how much
00:22:02.520 money it's SP just hit the button in the
00:22:03.640 computer and figure it out problem is
00:22:05.919 that button doesn't exist you know we
00:22:07.360 spent time early on I was uh Mar with
00:22:09.640 trying to track through like how does
00:22:11.360 the money actually flow we no one could
00:22:13.480 tell us how it actually flows where is
00:22:14.919 it going out people didn't know and it's
00:22:17.640 totally crazy and it's the reason all go
00:22:19.840 through treasury Antonio or like can you
00:22:21.720 just explain that to us well so I will
00:22:24.159 try to explain to you I'm not sure I
00:22:25.279 have full command of it I'm not sure
00:22:26.440 anyone does quite yet it goes to
00:22:28.720 treasury ultimately but it was supposed
00:22:30.640 to flow through the way it was supposed
00:22:32.360 to work in the it was changed in the 70
00:22:35.279 in the 70s in 1973 the Nixon
00:22:37.919 administration at in 71 let me go back
00:22:39.799 they came off the gold standard which
00:22:40.840 allowed deficits in 73 at the nater of
00:22:43.400 the Nixon presidency Congress took away
00:22:45.760 from the presidency the executive power
00:22:47.559 this thing called the porit which was
00:22:49.159 the power of the executive to stop
00:22:50.320 spending so Nixon was abusing it by
00:22:52.480 stoping he didn't want and so Congress
00:22:54.120 took away from him what that means today
00:22:55.520 is the executive as he reaches in it's
00:22:58.840 very hard to just stop payments so
00:23:01.400 what's happening is the the government
00:23:04.279 is is put in a process where they would
00:23:06.240 just have an an authorized executive
00:23:09.520 kind of stamp a bill that got paid that
00:23:11.640 broke and I don't know when it broke but
00:23:13.360 it broke sometime so the money flow now
00:23:16.720 department gets a budget authorized to
00:23:18.960 it uh by Congress it goes to om om
00:23:21.840 allocates the budget that department
00:23:24.279 then just sends a money request to
00:23:26.440 treasury to pay it is reconciled against
00:23:29.320 what happened this is one of the reasons
00:23:32.200 and that's it there's no there's no
00:23:33.720 there's no controller there's no
00:23:35.240 controller function like there is in a
00:23:36.600 normal company 100% there is no control
00:23:38.960 there is no controller there's no
00:23:40.960 reconciliation the reason they can't
00:23:42.640 pass audits okay there the reason this
00:23:45.120 happens is because you can't audit
00:23:46.720 something you haven't reconciled you the
00:23:49.120 only audit that I've seen is actually
00:23:50.960 from the Social Security Administration
00:23:52.400 and when you read it I've got one of
00:23:53.720 pars who have read the thing uh it has
00:23:56.200 it's just riddled material weaknesses
00:23:58.159 that you think there are individuals
00:23:59.960 that have made like millions or billions
00:24:02.200 of dollars from Mis payments overseas
00:24:04.679 like is this kind of what's gone on in
00:24:06.880 the missing money in Ukraine do you
00:24:08.400 think like it's kind of found its way to
00:24:10.159 the wrong places yeah I mean so what I
00:24:12.000 would I don't know what happened Ukraine
00:24:13.640 I don't crazy story yeah it is shocking
00:24:15.799 about Ukraine I will say that I have
00:24:17.600 business experience trying to work in
00:24:19.559 businesses that had Medicaid and
00:24:21.320 Medicaid medicare's payments I wanted to
00:24:23.039 make that better right we Weist to make
00:24:24.640 the world better and we just stopped cuz
00:24:27.360 we sound we found so much fraud I mean
00:24:29.760 I'm I'm certain we literally have a rule
00:24:32.159 here a government pay or in in those
00:24:34.240 areas if it's more than like a third of
00:24:35.799 the business we don't do it and in the
00:24:37.600 services space this is this is why we
00:24:39.720 just s we found continuous fraud in the
00:24:42.640 companies we're looking at investing in
00:24:44.120 yeah just threading these things
00:24:45.440 together you know you the really
00:24:47.520 interesting thing with the Twitter
00:24:50.520 pausing of payments was you know at some
00:24:52.720 point we were in a meeting you know at
00:24:54.360 1:00 a.m. on a Saturday and it was like
00:24:56.640 hey let's turn the credit cards off to
00:24:58.480 see what bounces and uh you know what
00:25:02.240 happens and then of course we start
00:25:04.240 getting calls and people started routing
00:25:06.679 obviously because they knew saaks was
00:25:08.440 there you were there I was there hey you
00:25:10.600 know a company who I shared an investor
00:25:13.600 with or you know in another company said
00:25:16.120 hey you know we're not getting paid for
00:25:17.440 this and it was like some SAS software
00:25:19.200 that nobody was using Etc so you start
00:25:21.640 figuring out to your point okay is this
00:25:24.720 software even being used there was so
00:25:26.600 much software and services that had been
00:25:28.799 paid that nobody had ever logged in to
00:25:31.720 set up so it was just being paid as pure
00:25:34.600 graph now you said Antonio correctly the
00:25:37.520 people who come first like they're
00:25:39.600 probably the ones who are in on the
00:25:41.080 biggest grift because hey you know I I
00:25:42.960 figured out how to grift this money how
00:25:45.240 us Aid got to the top of the Doge list I
00:25:48.120 think is one of the most interesting
00:25:49.960 aspects of this story so if you remember
00:25:53.399 on January 21st Trump decided he would
00:25:56.000 do a bunch of executive orders right and
00:25:58.000 one of them was to pause foreign aid for
00:26:00.440 90 days okay this seems reasonable we
00:26:03.240 got to take care of our country that was
00:26:04.799 part of his mandate for becoming the
00:26:07.039 47th president of the United States so
00:26:09.399 couple of days later the White House
00:26:11.440 said hey this us a leadership is trying
00:26:14.440 to circumvent the executive order
00:26:16.440 they're in other words they're just
00:26:17.240 going to keep paying people even though
00:26:19.279 the executive order came out that
00:26:21.840 alerted the Doge team so Elon confirmed
00:26:24.679 this on X he said quote all Doge did was
00:26:27.600 check to see which federal organizations
00:26:29.520 were violating the president's executive
00:26:31.799 orders the most turned out to be us Aid
00:26:35.120 so that became our focus and according
00:26:37.880 to NBC security officials at USA tried
00:26:40.480 to prevent Doge from even getting into
00:26:42.840 the building or accessing the systems to
00:26:45.159 your point Antonio the person probably
00:26:47.600 who's got the most to hide is the one
00:26:49.559 who's going to fight the most over the
00:26:51.720 weekend Doge gained access to us Aid and
00:26:55.000 then people started tweeting out all of
00:26:57.840 this
00:26:58.840 you know crazy spend and things that any
00:27:01.799 American who looks at it and says wait a
00:27:04.320 second if we haven't fixed the goddamn
00:27:05.919 water in Flint Michigan why are we
00:27:08.240 sending money to gallway or in Ireland
00:27:10.159 to do a Dei musical this makes no sense
00:27:13.200 and that's I think the key piece of this
00:27:14.840 Antonio is can you win the hearts and
00:27:17.360 minds of
00:27:18.919 Americans because some of this stuff I
00:27:21.720 don't know if it's legal or it's not
00:27:23.799 legal or it's against protocol or it is
00:27:26.279 protocol we're going to find out there's
00:27:27.480 been tons of of legal um cases and
00:27:30.919 lawsuits that have been filed but to
00:27:33.320 your point this is how Elon found out
00:27:35.679 about usaid J let me ask you a question
00:27:38.600 where where does that place you in
00:27:41.120 your political philosophy around the
00:27:43.440 importance of Human Rights
00:27:45.360 abroad great great
00:27:48.200 question you know I've always felt that
00:27:51.320 uh the West should act in unison and if
00:27:53.559 the United States is the greatest
00:27:54.880 economy or the strongest we should lead
00:27:57.440 there is something called the Universal
00:27:58.679 Declaration of Human Rights the United
00:28:00.679 States Elanor Roosevelt uh wrote this at
00:28:03.120 the UN and everybody tries to hit those
00:28:05.039 notes I think it's great that we try to
00:28:07.799 reduce suffering in the world but I
00:28:09.399 think we should be doing it not
00:28:11.000 unilaterally and not to try to
00:28:13.000 manipulate governments and that's the
00:28:14.799 piece of this that us Aid is obviously a
00:28:17.880 grift where people are trying to steal
00:28:19.640 money for their pet projects and I don't
00:28:22.320 think they're acting in unison and above
00:28:24.200 board to look and say okay where's the
00:28:27.279 most suffering in the world how can we
00:28:29.240 help that you know that that to me seems
00:28:31.120 like a noble thing to do and if the
00:28:32.679 United States has the budget to help
00:28:34.880 fight AIDS in Africa or you know poverty
00:28:38.200 you there's a chance that some of these
00:28:40.080 human rights
00:28:41.720 issues were embellished to try to get
00:28:44.279 more money well I do think the you know
00:28:47.159 I I did this tweet recently so yes is
00:28:49.519 the answer if you look at Amnesty
00:28:51.279 International Amnesty International
00:28:52.840 where I worked was one of my first jobs
00:28:54.960 they were work working on people who
00:28:56.640 were imprisoned tortured
00:28:58.559 raped murdered systematic murder of
00:29:02.039 dissidents for freedom of speech freedom
00:29:04.399 of assembly religion Etc and then
00:29:06.760 somewhere along the line you know the
00:29:09.039 Amnesty International was tweeting about
00:29:10.799 trans rights and that's the big Focus
00:29:12.640 this is a very small amount of you know
00:29:15.640 people on the planet and I don't think
00:29:17.720 that those human rights violations in
00:29:19.760 any way relate to the tragedy we're
00:29:21.840 seeing of people being murdered tortured
00:29:23.720 raped and caned and and beheaded in
00:29:26.799 certain places in the world so
00:29:28.640 there there
00:29:30.279 is a way to look at suffering and say we
00:29:34.279 should handle this first and yes
00:29:36.120 somebody who you know uh feels they got
00:29:38.880 misgendered maybe that's way down the
00:29:41.000 priority list compared to systematic
00:29:44.200 rape of women in these you know War
00:29:46.200 zones those will be the high order bits
00:29:48.480 and so this thing has gotten the other
00:29:52.480 fascinating thing I think about USA
00:29:53.960 which I like to get your thoughts on too
00:29:55.360 jamath is at what point did this switch
00:29:59.559 from being the the left saying we should
00:30:03.320 not intervene right the left's position
00:30:05.320 always in the 8S 90s when we were
00:30:06.880 growing up was we shouldn't be doing
00:30:08.799 these operatives in other countries we
00:30:10.720 should let democracy flow let these
00:30:12.480 countries figure it out for themselves
00:30:14.120 we shouldn't be doing Empire building we
00:30:15.840 shouldn't be doing imperialism and then
00:30:18.240 all of a sudden now it's just such a
00:30:20.120 Griff that I think everybody's got their
00:30:21.559 hands in the pie lindsy Grahams on some
00:30:24.039 nonprofit that gets money from this I
00:30:25.840 don't know if that's above board or not
00:30:28.559 everybody a lot of people who are
00:30:30.440 formally in government seem to be part
00:30:32.279 of this NGO train so the whole thing
00:30:34.799 just turned out to be a grift and it's a
00:30:36.320 bipartisan grift
00:30:39.159 obviously I think the INF I think the
00:30:41.960 biggest thing that we will have to
00:30:44.120 confront is that many of the things that
00:30:46.399 we
00:30:48.559 thought were issues or
00:30:51.480 problems may have actually been somewhat
00:30:55.399 embellished because of this money cycle
00:30:58.519 sure and I think that that's going to
00:31:00.320 cause a lot of people to feel really
00:31:04.200 they'll probably feel really foolish
00:31:05.880 about some of the decisions they made
00:31:07.960 all the attempts at cancellation are
00:31:09.600 going to look really dumb in hindsight
00:31:12.039 yeah all right ni some gra to our friend
00:31:14.480 David saaks here who's coming online
00:31:15.960 okay here he is
00:31:16.960 David and and the one thing I want to uh
00:31:19.840 point out this goes way back I think
00:31:22.559 maybe more than a decade ago David tried
00:31:25.519 to explain to me that neocons had taken
00:31:27.559 over American foreign policy and they
00:31:29.880 were well your question about why did
00:31:31.679 the Democrats change Why did Republicans
00:31:33.480 change Etc the neocons took over foreign
00:31:35.559 policy in both sides Democrats and
00:31:37.200 Republicans and populated out this very
00:31:39.440 activist muster stance which is bad for
00:31:41.120 America and I think Jason that answerers
00:31:42.799 your question as to why the Democrat
00:31:44.480 shifted all right with us is David Sachs
00:31:47.200 how you doing brother are are you
00:31:48.960 literally in the white house I'm in the
00:31:51.519 uh
00:31:52.840 EOB ah okay there's like a podcast
00:31:55.519 Studio actually in the EOB oh fantastic
00:31:58.480 and you're wearing a suit every day yeah
00:32:00.240 know you're right I have to wear a suit
00:32:01.200 and tie every day I was just listening
00:32:03.080 on your your conversation about Doge
00:32:05.919 jakeob I'm surprised that you never
00:32:07.240 figured out a way to get involved in
00:32:08.559 this
00:32:09.440 USA I mean everybody's on the take
00:32:11.960 except you what's going I had known I
00:32:14.159 would have started an NGO where's my NGO
00:32:17.200 you had everything except the money
00:32:18.480 laundering you had the grip you had the
00:32:20.279 virtue signaling you had it all except
00:32:22.960 act money let me uplevel this for a
00:32:25.080 second okay so we knew the US government
00:32:28.639 runs a $2 trillion deficit every year
00:32:31.279 we're in debt almost $40 trillion and we
00:32:34.200 also knew that anytime anyone tries to
00:32:36.000 cut anything in Washington the whole
00:32:37.919 city screams bloody murder okay so the
00:32:39.960 question is just Why well now we know
00:32:42.320 the money is all going to them it's like
00:32:44.120 round tripping to them New York Times
00:32:46.960 getting paid Politico getting paid bill
00:32:50.760 Crystal perennial warmonger getting paid
00:32:54.639 Ukraine getting paid like 11 out of 12
00:32:56.760 Publications Ukraine getting paid
00:32:58.600 incredible Victor Orban who's the Prime
00:33:00.519 Minister of Hungary was saying that he's
00:33:02.720 very popular in Hungary his political
00:33:04.799 opposition funded by usaid in Poland the
00:33:09.440 leftwing political opposition funded by
00:33:11.799 usaid and on and on and on it goes BBC
00:33:14.720 BBC you wonder why everyone in the UK so
00:33:17.080 yeah yeah believe the BBC is getting
00:33:19.600 paid every leftwing organization in the
00:33:22.120 world seems to be getting paid by this
00:33:25.519 slush fund at usaid which disperses
00:33:28.279 about 50 billion a year that's a billion
00:33:29.919 dollars a week that's actually a lot of
00:33:32.080 money and so it it just it makes you
00:33:34.679 wonder you know the left in general
00:33:36.519 tries to portray itself as a movement of
00:33:39.080 the people that it's Grassroots this is
00:33:41.519 the exact opposite this is AstroTurf
00:33:43.320 this is basically money coming from the
00:33:45.279 top down out of Washington to fund all
00:33:47.840 these groups maybe not even in the
00:33:49.200 United States like all over the world so
00:33:51.360 it makes you wonder what is the real
00:33:53.399 level of local support for these
00:33:56.240 leftwing policies all over the world
00:33:59.039 yeah crazy so you did a big announcement
00:34:01.440 this week on
00:34:02.600 crypto and creating a framework finally
00:34:06.120 I I caught some of it maybe you could
00:34:08.320 just tell us you know from the bottom up
00:34:10.800 what is the Mandate from the president
00:34:13.280 and what is your advice to him on how to
00:34:16.119 make crypto move out of the Shadows
00:34:19.639 offshore icos craziness to legitimacy
00:34:23.440 what's the plan here to legitimize and
00:34:25.520 regulate crypto well the the plan was
00:34:28.119 really spelled out by President Trump
00:34:29.800 and his week one EO on crypto and it's
00:34:32.440 all spelled out in there the principal
00:34:34.199 Administration on crypto the president
00:34:36.040 said he wants to support the responsible
00:34:37.800 use and growth of digital assets and
00:34:41.639 blockchains across every sector of the
00:34:43.760 economy so the principles are all there
00:34:46.560 and yesterday I was invited up to
00:34:48.599 Capitol Hill to meet with the the
00:34:51.239 chairman of the important committees
00:34:53.480 that will be that basically govern
00:34:55.879 crypto and so we had a conference there
00:34:58.400 to announce the legislative plan you can
00:35:01.000 see there there's chairman Tim Scott
00:35:03.359 who's the chair of the Senate Banking
00:35:05.720 Committee to my left and then to my
00:35:07.920 right is french hill who's the chairman
00:35:09.920 of the house Financial Services
00:35:11.079 committee and then to his right is John
00:35:15.040 Boseman who's the chair of the Senate
00:35:17.480 agriculture committee and then to the
00:35:20.200 left of Tim Scott is um GT Thompson
00:35:23.520 who's the chair of the house agriculture
00:35:25.880 committee he's out of frame right now
00:35:27.760 now but those are the four committees
00:35:29.480 that govern crypto and you may ask why
00:35:31.240 is the agriculture Committee involved in
00:35:32.880 crypto and the reason is because the ad
00:35:35.160 committee supervises the cftc the
00:35:38.599 Commodities Futures Trading Commission
00:35:40.440 because Commodities all came out of
00:35:42.480 Agriculture so it's interesting you need
00:35:45.640 four committees across the House and
00:35:47.680 Senate to get legislation done on crypto
00:35:50.920 it's not just House and Senate it's
00:35:52.480 actually two committees in each of the
00:35:53.720 House and Senate and so this is the
00:35:56.400 first time where we've had had four
00:35:58.400 chairman of the four key committees all
00:36:00.520 come together and say that they're ready
00:36:02.480 to support crypto legislation there were
00:36:04.680 a lot of people on a who felt like this
00:36:06.920 wasn't you know a mind-blowing
00:36:08.560 announcement they wanted something that
00:36:09.800 they could trade on right away that's
00:36:11.720 not what this was this was basically a
00:36:14.240 statement of commitment from the chairs
00:36:16.640 of the four committees that we're going
00:36:17.839 to get legislation done this year maybe
00:36:20.280 in the next six months I mean that's
00:36:21.599 really the goal and we've never had that
00:36:23.440 before so that is pretty Monumental I
00:36:25.640 used to work in this because when I
00:36:28.240 first launched climate Court back in the
00:36:29.839 day we actually were selling commodity
00:36:31.560 contracts online so we we set ourselves
00:36:33.800 up as an exempt
00:36:36.000 commodity trading platform and I so I I
00:36:39.720 remember all this old legislation there
00:36:41.440 was the commodity Futures modernization
00:36:43.400 act if I remember when they deregulated
00:36:46.359 the energy Market but one of the
00:36:48.000 features of the commodity features
00:36:50.240 modernization Act was that they created
00:36:52.640 this concept of an exempt commodity
00:36:54.359 contract which was where you're not
00:36:56.119 delivering a physical good
00:36:58.200 and that's basically what weather
00:36:59.680 derivatives were and energy derivatives
00:37:01.880 and other kind of indices were created
00:37:04.680 that didn't have a tangible physical
00:37:06.680 Supply and it was still kind of shoveled
00:37:08.400 in the uh in the Commodities world
00:37:10.440 that's why the legacy of all this stuff
00:37:11.920 kind of sitting with agriculture is that
00:37:14.079 the way this is likely going to move
00:37:15.240 forward is it's going to look like a new
00:37:16.599 extension of exempt Commodities and kind
00:37:18.400 of treated like that versus being
00:37:20.760 Securities the question you're
00:37:22.319 describing is called Market structure
00:37:25.040 you know what are the definitions going
00:37:26.960 to be because digital assets can be many
00:37:28.800 things you can have some digital assets
00:37:31.079 are cryptocurrencies they're actually
00:37:32.920 currencies then there's things that are
00:37:35.000 crypto Securities then there's things
00:37:37.000 that are Commodities Bitcoin actually is
00:37:38.960 regulated as a commodity right now and
00:37:41.280 then you've got things that aren't
00:37:43.839 Securities or Commodities they're like
00:37:45.240 Collectibles you know like nfts things
00:37:46.960 like that so there's all these different
00:37:49.200 categories and one of the things that
00:37:50.680 the market needs is just Clarity around
00:37:52.440 the definition so that Founders know
00:37:54.839 what the rules of Road are and they can
00:37:56.440 actually just comply with that
00:37:58.000 so giving them those definitions and
00:38:01.480 describing how a crypto project could
00:38:04.800 start for example as a security and
00:38:07.040 eventually the protocol could become
00:38:09.920 decentralized enough or maybe it becomes
00:38:11.880 a commodity that whole idea that's
00:38:15.599 called Market structure and there was a
00:38:17.480 bill in the last Congress by french hill
00:38:19.760 who is the chair of the house Financial
00:38:21.560 Services committee now that passed the
00:38:24.240 house with 71 Democratic um votes so was
00:38:27.800 fairly bipartisan but then it went
00:38:30.079 nowhere in the Senate because frankly
00:38:32.160 the bank committee at that time was run
00:38:34.440 by shered Brown who was anti- crypto so
00:38:36.880 it got stopped in the Senate right away
00:38:39.200 now we have Republican control of the
00:38:41.200 Senate and Tim Scott's the new chair of
00:38:42.839 the Senate Banking Committee and he's
00:38:44.319 expressed support so I think now we
00:38:46.640 could get a bill on Market structure
00:38:48.319 like fit21 again which was fren shills
00:38:50.400 Bill last Congress I think we could do a
00:38:53.160 revised and updated version this
00:38:54.760 Congress and that was one of the things
00:38:56.720 they all that the chairman expressed
00:38:58.240 support for so I think there's a pretty
00:39:00.000 good chance we could get this done in
00:39:01.040 the next six months what's the
00:39:02.599 opposition sax I guess it feels to me
00:39:05.079 like with the market structure question
00:39:06.960 being addressed and answered you would
00:39:09.359 have also more protection for consumers
00:39:11.560 because now businesses know the rules of
00:39:12.960 the road they follow them the structure
00:39:14.640 that protects consumers etc etc why
00:39:17.119 would people be opposed to moving this
00:39:18.880 forward moving the legislation forward
00:39:20.440 getting this all behind us well I think
00:39:22.680 this is an area where there's a really
00:39:24.040 good chance of having bipartison support
00:39:28.680 we did in the last Congress like I
00:39:30.040 mentioned that the house bill got over
00:39:32.000 70 Democratic votes I think in the
00:39:34.160 Senate we're going to need seven votes
00:39:37.079 seven Democrat votes to get to 60 right
00:39:39.200 which is the number you need if you
00:39:40.920 don't go through the reconciliation
00:39:42.839 process and I think there's a good
00:39:44.480 chance this passes with significant
00:39:46.880 Democratic support as well as Republican
00:39:49.280 it's not going to be unanimous or
00:39:50.319 anything like that because there are
00:39:52.319 still forces that are hostile to crypto
00:39:56.960 in Washington and do you think it's
00:39:58.720 going to be a discret bill or do you I I
00:40:00.880 mean it seems
00:40:02.240 like you're going to have to get a
00:40:04.800 border security and energy and budget
00:40:08.319 bill passed so it seems like
00:40:10.720 everything's looking towards
00:40:12.800 reconciliation in which case would this
00:40:15.359 be an ad junk like a like an add-on the
00:40:18.200 the question is what you can get through
00:40:19.440 reconciliation so in order for a bill to
00:40:21.880 go through the reconciliation process
00:40:23.400 where you only need basically 50 votes
00:40:25.960 it has to have a budgetary impact or
00:40:28.440 predominantly a budgetary impact I think
00:40:30.880 it's called the bird Rule and that rule
00:40:34.240 was definitely pushed pretty hard in the
00:40:36.640 last Administration you remember that
00:40:38.640 the bid Administration got the inflation
00:40:40.560 reduction Act passed through
00:40:43.119 reconciliation and all those subsidies
00:40:45.359 for clean energy or whatever so they've
00:40:47.319 opened the window pretty wide on what
00:40:49.560 can go through reconciliation but that's
00:40:51.800 the question there's one other bill that
00:40:54.480 I think is going to move pretty quickly
00:40:55.880 here too so I just mentioned the market
00:40:57.359 structure Bill the other area is stable
00:40:59.720 coins and Senator Hagerty he's on the
00:41:02.960 Banking Committee he just released a
00:41:04.640 stable coin bill there's counterparts in
00:41:06.440 the house and what the four chairman
00:41:09.319 indicated is actually they're going to
00:41:10.880 take up stable coins first and then
00:41:12.920 Market structure will follow very
00:41:14.319 quickly so I think we could see a stable
00:41:16.520 coin
00:41:17.359 bill pass Congress in the next several
00:41:20.040 months sax I guess the question is the
00:41:22.880 SEC was and Gary Gensler were the
00:41:26.680 blocker
00:41:28.040 previously with crypto and they just
00:41:30.160 said Hey listen there's an existing set
00:41:31.599 of rules here just follow those rules
00:41:33.640 obviously those rules don't exactly
00:41:35.839 apply to the Innovation happening in
00:41:37.359 crypto so the question I think after
00:41:40.000 stable coins which feels like a layup
00:41:41.800 and and a great place to start that'll
00:41:43.119 be a great early win and it just makes
00:41:45.560 people I guess that would just reinforce
00:41:47.839 the dollar Supremacy right if it's tied
00:41:49.720 to the dollar so that's good for
00:41:51.440 America but maybe you could talk to
00:41:54.119 protecting consumers because we all saw
00:41:56.640 in the first couple of generations of
00:41:59.040 crypto all kinds of griffs and icos and
00:42:01.240 things that were never delivered so how
00:42:03.359 do you balance those two things
00:42:04.760 protecting consumers who may get really
00:42:07.119 enthusiastic about this versus you know
00:42:11.040 people who might try to Prey Upon them
00:42:14.280 well the first thing you want to do if
00:42:15.319 you're going to protect consumers is you
00:42:16.960 want to bring the activity on Shore okay
00:42:19.680 because obviously when all the activity
00:42:21.760 gets driven offshore then it's hard for
00:42:24.480 Regulators to supervise it and moreover
00:42:26.800 it's hard for the market to know who's a
00:42:29.000 good actor who's a bad actor what's a
00:42:30.520 good project what's a bad project so the
00:42:32.720 first thing you want to do is have the
00:42:34.119 Innovation happen onshore in the United
00:42:36.079 States by the way it's probably not a
00:42:37.680 coincidence that the biggest fraud in
00:42:39.319 the history of crypto which was FTX was
00:42:42.160 based in the Bahamas yeah probably
00:42:44.559 little bit of a tell a little bit of a
00:42:45.839 tell and it'll be an even stronger tell
00:42:48.079 when the good projects feel like they
00:42:49.480 can come back into the United States and
00:42:51.440 then you've got the Shady ones in the
00:42:53.400 Bahamas or in other countries that
00:42:54.680 they're going to stick out like a sore
00:42:55.680 thumb everyone's going to be able to
00:42:56.839 understand that oh those guys are too
00:42:58.880 shady to operate in the United States so
00:43:01.640 the number one thing we need to do is
00:43:02.640 just bring the Innovation on Shore in
00:43:05.240 terms of the framework I think the
00:43:07.040 market structure bill is going to Define
00:43:08.920 here's a security here's a commodity
00:43:10.720 here's what you have to do here are the
00:43:12.040 disclosure requirements around creating
00:43:15.520 a crypto project so all of that will be
00:43:18.400 in the bill and then in the meantime the
00:43:20.559 SEC has created a new task force under
00:43:24.040 Hester Pur who's a sec commissioner and
00:43:27.160 she is already starting to do work in
00:43:29.079 that regard to define a better regime at
00:43:32.480 the SEC for crypto
00:43:34.280 projects you mentioned that gendler said
00:43:37.440 that the sec's doors were open to crypto
00:43:40.359 companies and they should come in and
00:43:42.400 talk to us and work with us that was
00:43:44.079 very
00:43:44.960 disingenuous crypto companies would tell
00:43:46.920 me they would go see the SEC the SEC
00:43:49.480 would tell them nothing about what the
00:43:50.640 rules were but they would have
00:43:52.440 enforcement people in those meetings
00:43:53.880 just writing down everything they would
00:43:55.160 say and the next day they would get sent
00:43:56.720 a well notice so the truth is the SEC
00:43:59.200 was not cooperating they were not
00:44:01.079 providing any Clarity they were just
00:44:02.599 honeypotting Founders basically to come
00:44:04.440 in and then they would immediately
00:44:06.559 investigate them I mean it was really
00:44:08.280 terrible look we expect Founders to play
00:44:10.880 by the rules and abide by the law and be
00:44:13.559 compliant but when you won't tell them
00:44:15.400 what the rules are and then you
00:44:16.400 prosecute them there's no fair way for
00:44:18.640 them to comply so the most important
00:44:21.319 thing is to give them a framework I
00:44:22.760 think the SEC now is doing that they're
00:44:24.559 starting to do that already and then
00:44:26.280 legislatively we're going to have a bill
00:44:27.960 that does that uh moving through
00:44:30.200 Congress over the next few months this
00:44:32.400 is absolutely awesome we're super
00:44:34.160 encouraged that you're doing this and uh
00:44:36.319 we really appreciate you coming on the
00:44:37.839 Pod uh wish you could participate in the
00:44:40.200 other three or four crazy discussions
00:44:41.760 we're about to have but we understand
00:44:43.480 you've got to stay focused on the
00:44:44.800 mission uh anything on the AI front that
00:44:47.880 we can look forward to in the coming
00:44:49.359 weeks that you're working on I know
00:44:50.760 that's the other part of your
00:44:52.319 mission well the big thing is like I
00:44:54.920 talked about last time the president
00:44:56.319 rescinded the Biden EO which was this
00:44:58.440 100 page monstrosity of burn some
00:45:00.079 regulation on our AI companies I think
00:45:03.040 that decision's been proven even more
00:45:05.119 right in the wake of deep seek because
00:45:06.800 we know that China has basically caught
00:45:09.359 up or they're very very close to
00:45:10.599 catching up it felt like that Biden EO
00:45:12.839 is written in a vacuum in which the US
00:45:14.880 was the only player in Ai and that if we
00:45:17.200 imposed a bunch of burns some rules on
00:45:19.520 our companies that somehow that wouldn't
00:45:21.520 allow China to catch up right and I
00:45:23.000 think it's pretty clear that China is
00:45:24.800 very very competitive if we R AI
00:45:27.920 companies is going to run down to
00:45:29.680 China's benefits so I think that was a
00:45:31.680 very good decision and what the
00:45:33.400 president said in his EO is that we
00:45:36.200 should devise a new AI action plan to
00:45:38.480 replace that by Neo and we're working on
00:45:40.599 that right now all right d any fun
00:45:43.440 anecdotes from Doge you want to share
00:45:45.319 I'll give you one anecdote which is I've
00:45:47.240 been working late here a number of
00:45:48.960 nights at the EOB and I won't tell you
00:45:51.280 where the Doge guys are based but you
00:45:52.760 know I know where their office is so I
00:45:54.040 just went by there to say hi the whole
00:45:56.079 room was full
00:45:57.680 of young coders I think they were
00:46:00.280 engineers but they're wearing like suits
00:46:01.559 and ties so that's a little different
00:46:03.680 but they were all working really late I
00:46:05.720 mean they're working there late up
00:46:07.040 Friday night and the facilities people
00:46:10.680 don't know what to do because they've
00:46:12.000 never had people like asked to stay late
00:46:14.000 on before so they've had to create new
00:46:17.319 uh new facilities access for for these
00:46:19.920 guys they're like you're coming to the
00:46:21.680 office and doing work we don't have a
00:46:23.520 protocol for that what how does that
00:46:25.559 work we gonna need to get you a he
00:46:27.160 you're a badge to come to the building
00:46:29.200 yeah uh well it's absolutely awesome to
00:46:31.160 see the progress you're making in the
00:46:33.400 first two weeks and continued success
00:46:35.559 we're so proud of the
00:46:37.960 effort all right thanks guys all right
00:46:41.760 do you guys think the Democrats are
00:46:43.440 going to lose people over their
00:46:46.440 opposition to Doge like is Doge really
00:46:49.359 viewed as oppositional to Democrat party
00:46:51.920 interests this is for the average person
00:46:54.800 it's a war Shack TK I think the thing is
00:46:57.079 that there was a coalition that the
00:46:59.040 Democrats had and there was a coalition
00:47:01.119 that the Republicans had the Republicans
00:47:03.680 did a better job of reforming that
00:47:06.880 Coalition and now I think what you're
00:47:08.800 going to see is a shrinking I actually
00:47:11.040 got this totally wrong I don't know if
00:47:12.280 you remember a couple years ago but my
00:47:14.839 thought at the time was if the
00:47:17.079 Republicans don't figure out how to fix
00:47:19.640 themselves they were going to go and
00:47:22.599 lose for the next 10 or 15 years and the
00:47:24.880 reason I said that was they would walk
00:47:26.280 into every M term and they would just
00:47:27.720 get their ass handed to them but I think
00:47:30.160 they figured it out that this is sort of
00:47:32.440 this thing that I've been thinking about
00:47:33.559 a lot is there's a fight in Western
00:47:37.359 societies and it's a pendulum between
00:47:39.599 labor and capital and it used to be the
00:47:42.480 thought the conventional wisdom was that
00:47:44.119 the
00:47:45.079 Republicans were Pro capital and
00:47:48.280 Democrats were pro- labor and the
00:47:50.960 Brilliance of trump is he took over the
00:47:53.040 Republican party and made it totally
00:47:55.240 populist which is to say Pro
00:47:57.559 labor and the crazy thing about the
00:48:00.440 Democrats is that they are the most
00:48:04.359 sophisticated
00:48:05.880 Liars because if you look at what
00:48:08.400 happened under
00:48:09.920 Biden you had record high stock markets
00:48:12.920 so it was purely in favor of asset
00:48:15.000 owners record high deficits record high
00:48:18.800 illegal immigration record high wage
00:48:21.839 suppression all of these things are
00:48:23.760 massively Pro Capital but they tried to
00:48:25.520 present themselves as Pro labor
00:48:27.960 that entire ruse is now being undone and
00:48:31.280 all of this data what that does is it'll
00:48:33.400 it'll consolidate the Democrats to a
00:48:35.319 shell of their former self it'll take a
00:48:37.640 year or 18 months but I think unless
00:48:40.760 they figure out how to totally hard
00:48:42.760 reset they're going to be in a really
00:48:44.920 difficult struggle to find a cohort of
00:48:46.960 people Beyond 15 or 20% of the
00:48:49.720 population for a long time well and it's
00:48:51.760 so dumb to come out against waste Fraud
00:48:54.559 and Abuse so the best argument that
00:48:56.839 Democrats had it seems was that oh my
00:49:00.160 God people's Social Security numbers or
00:49:03.040 people's privacy was being violated
00:49:06.079 because they went in and looked at the
00:49:08.079 data and how the money was raed wasted
00:49:10.799 this is the like height of not getting
00:49:13.440 the point and not reading the room 100%
00:49:16.000 of Americans don't want their tax
00:49:17.880 payments stolen they don't care if you
00:49:20.920 looked at their social security number
00:49:22.480 this isn't a privacy issue that doge is
00:49:24.839 looking at some database and that's
00:49:26.720 that's what AOC and Schumer were doing
00:49:29.119 oh my God these people are looking at
00:49:31.440 your social security number they have
00:49:33.240 access to your records who cares what
00:49:35.440 matters is how much money is being
00:49:37.319 stolen from the American public and
00:49:40.040 anyone at any point in time could have
00:49:42.119 picked up this issue this has been going
00:49:44.119 on I think you pointed out the last time
00:49:46.359 somebody really addressed this in
00:49:47.720 Earnest was Clinton so this has been
00:49:49.960 going on Obama Trump 1.0 Biden everybody
00:49:55.280 has been raising the debt all of this
00:49:57.200 grift has been going on and it's only
00:49:58.839 this time around that somebody picked up
00:50:00.680 the free money and said here's an issue
00:50:03.079 now we uh we see what happens when
00:50:06.720 somebody picks up the issue of stop
00:50:09.079 wasting money it is a popular issue this
00:50:11.520 is only going to make Trump more popular
00:50:13.920 so Jason I I um G add what you and Jamal
00:50:17.079 said I think you're both right I'm give
00:50:18.240 you a very concrete example Ram Emanuel
00:50:20.720 is now back from Japan okay he was Chief
00:50:22.839 of Staff in both the Democratic white
00:50:24.880 houses post uh Rose
00:50:27.559 um Clinton and Obama and he wrote an
00:50:29.599 oped this weekend this past weekend um
00:50:32.400 that basically said the Democrats have
00:50:33.640 lost their way because they have
00:50:35.480 forgotten what he calls kitchen table
00:50:37.680 issues the things people regular people
00:50:39.920 care about and jamat you're right I mean
00:50:42.040 the the reality is um they forgot about
00:50:44.280 inflation they forgot that inflation is
00:50:46.640 terrible for the average person it's
00:50:48.720 terrible for middle class America it's
00:50:50.240 okay for people that own productive
00:50:52.440 assets because they just go up in value
00:50:54.079 but it's terrible for people that are
00:50:55.440 wage earners and that have any savings
00:50:57.200 it's terrible for older people that are
00:50:58.760 living off savings terrible you know Rob
00:51:01.319 makes this point that if the Democrats
00:51:02.520 are going have to are going to
00:51:03.599 reconformation
00:51:24.920 [Music]
00:51:26.680 because of all of these other issues so
00:51:28.640 they have no home there is no base from
00:51:31.240 which to build from right now unless
00:51:32.960 they go through a great reset and part
00:51:35.160 of it is that they have to understand
00:51:37.440 that they are actually not pro labor
00:51:40.920 they are have been Pro Capital but that
00:51:43.319 requires such a Schism from the deepest
00:51:46.599 Believers of the democratic party who
00:51:48.680 thought you know Eat the Rich you wear
00:51:51.040 it on your dress it's so important to
00:51:52.799 you in fact actually you were feeding
00:51:54.520 the rich you just and the that you
00:51:57.040 didn't even know that is just pathetic
00:51:59.680 yeah what's funny is that you know Marg
00:52:01.000 thater famous has said that the problem
00:52:02.640 of socialism you eventually run out of
00:52:04.319 other people's money and you run
00:52:06.119 deficits right and you destroy the
00:52:07.200 country this happened in Venezuela this
00:52:08.520 is always the end of socialism it's how
00:52:09.880 it it's how it finishes it's how the
00:52:11.040 movie ends we've seen it around the
00:52:12.319 world just look look South into South
00:52:15.000 America we were heading that direction
00:52:16.960 that's what I said earlier we I was I'm
00:52:19.400 afraid we might become a kleptocracy if
00:52:21.359 this doesn't stop and I'm so grateful to
00:52:23.440 all the great Patriots of Doge and the
00:52:24.760 government the president for making it
00:52:25.839 happen cuz we were heading that
00:52:27.200 direction so the Democratic party is
00:52:29.359 lost they'll continue to be lost
00:52:31.960 interesting thing came up this week on
00:52:34.200 Monday president Trump signed an
00:52:35.960 executive order laying out a plan to
00:52:37.880 establish the first Sovereign wealth
00:52:40.319 fund for the United States for those of
00:52:41.880 you who don't know a sovereign wealth
00:52:43.040 fund is essentially an investment fund
00:52:46.160 for a country it's almost universally
00:52:48.799 based on natural resources so Norway
00:52:52.640 Saudi UAE they all have uh Australia
00:52:55.920 sovereign weal funds based upon minerals
00:52:58.440 or typically oil the United States is
00:53:00.920 not known for having the oil reserves of
00:53:03.520 the Saudis or UAE or Norway this public
00:53:08.000 investment
00:53:09.319 fund would be
00:53:12.280 apparently anchored by
00:53:15.480 potentially The Tick Tock shares that
00:53:18.680 Trump said he wanted to get half of by
00:53:21.280 giving a
00:53:23.799 license a lot of that is uh unclear what
00:53:27.359 this license would be it's never existed
00:53:30.079 but this is the concept the treasury
00:53:33.000 secretary and Commerce Secretary have
00:53:35.079 been tasked with developing a plan over
00:53:37.319 the next 90 days and uh the plan should
00:53:40.960 include quote recommendations for
00:53:42.760 funding mechanisms investment Strategies
00:53:44.920 Fund structure and a governance model
00:53:47.599 chamath you were tweeting about this
00:53:49.920 what is the point of having a sovereign
00:53:53.359 wealth Fund in the United States if
00:53:55.079 we're 36 trillion in debt shouldn't we
00:53:57.680 just pay
00:53:59.319 down I I think it's not where this money
00:54:02.760 going to come from yeah well it's not an
00:54:04.160 either or thing and I think the point is
00:54:05.799 that if there are assets that are minted
00:54:08.960 effectively overnight which I think the
00:54:10.760 50% share of Tik Tok would be so call
00:54:13.160 it1 $150 billion doar the question is
00:54:16.240 what should you do with it and who
00:54:18.119 should govern it and I think this idea
00:54:19.799 that if you had a group of five Elder
00:54:22.359 Statesmen so I'm just going to throw
00:54:23.680 some names out there David terer Stan
00:54:26.400 ruen Miller Ken Griffin John dor or Mike
00:54:29.400 morritz Bill gross or some other Bond
00:54:32.200 guy my point is what you get are five
00:54:34.559 people that are very sophisticated
00:54:36.720 across all Market
00:54:38.280 categories one of them could be the
00:54:40.200 rotating CEO for some number of years
00:54:42.599 people should rotate in and rotate out
00:54:44.480 these are unpaid jobs because everybody
00:54:46.880 that has these slots should be Mega
00:54:49.000 billionaires so they shouldn't be doing
00:54:50.520 it for their own personal advancement
00:54:52.440 and they should deploy that Capital so
00:54:54.440 as you sell down the Tik Tok shares
00:54:56.839 maybe as you sell Federal lands and you
00:54:58.680 generate more oil Revenue take it all
00:55:01.599 and invest it on behalf of America into
00:55:04.359 American companies I think that's a
00:55:06.319 great incredible idea Antonio you think
00:55:09.520 the government should be in this
00:55:11.599 business so I have I I think it I think
00:55:14.200 it should but and I agree with shth uh
00:55:16.799 that the governance is very very
00:55:17.920 important I think he's got a good idea
00:55:20.280 there I think it for a different reason
00:55:22.920 is that we don't have an industrial
00:55:24.319 policy in America uh many of our
00:55:26.720 competitors around the world in
00:55:27.839 particular China have a long-term
00:55:30.319 industrial policy and they put enormous
00:55:32.760 amounts of capital behind the industrial
00:55:34.200 policy uh a sovereign wealth fund I
00:55:36.760 think would be a stealthy way to create
00:55:38.920 industrial policy in America so rather
00:55:40.839 mean industrial policy in this context
00:55:42.559 so example in China they want to they
00:55:46.000 want to build chip Fabs and they want to
00:55:47.359 catch up to to uh
00:55:49.920 tsmc so what do they do they take the
00:55:53.160 dollars of Trade Surplus they get from
00:55:54.680 US every year and they pour back into
00:55:56.960 making that stuff inside their country
00:55:58.520 and for decades part of the problem
00:56:00.760 we've had with China is that capital is
00:56:02.520 free because the banking system just
00:56:04.280 pushes money out to manufacturers and
00:56:05.520 they move the manufacturing because the
00:56:06.680 WTO from the US to China that's the
00:56:08.640 industrial policy people say the Chinese
00:56:10.480 have a long-term 100-year Vision the way
00:56:12.520 it's it manifests is this industrial
00:56:14.440 policy we don't have that here at all
00:56:16.520 and we try to do it we do like the chips
00:56:18.440 act and it goes through Commerce we have
00:56:20.359 government bureaucrats deciding how to
00:56:22.319 spend $200 billion to modernize Intel
00:56:25.359 which needs to happen I mean I'd much
00:56:27.280 rather have Ken Griffin Bill gross any
00:56:30.440 of the guys choth mentioned deciding
00:56:32.640 okay we have five Industries in America
00:56:34.319 we want to invest in let's make great
00:56:35.960 Investments right I mean let's make
00:56:37.359 great Investments for America they got
00:56:38.359 to be economic they got they got to make
00:56:40.039 money for us but they got to be good for
00:56:41.440 the country I think that's what most
00:56:42.880 these Sovereign wealth funds do some of
00:56:44.079 them make portfolio Investments but many
00:56:45.799 of them like the The Sovereign wealth
00:56:47.079 Fund in Saudi Arabia the piff they're
00:56:48.559 making enormous Investments domestically
00:56:50.599 to remake the economy you know toward
00:56:52.920 tourism example and I think this is a
00:56:54.720 great idea they're literally building CI
00:56:56.480 in neom they've got you know a dozen
00:56:58.720 cities being
00:57:00.200 constructed and trying to take an oil
00:57:02.799 economy and shift it to a tourism
00:57:05.200 economy a technology economy a private
00:57:07.799 Equity economy Antonio is totally right
00:57:09.839 like Scott bessent part of his
00:57:12.359 Congressional testimony you guys
00:57:14.599 probably saw this was he laid out this
00:57:16.039 thing that he has that's called the 333
00:57:18.119 plan right in the 333 plan says we want
00:57:21.039 to see GDP growth of 3% we want to see
00:57:24.520 deficits that are no greater than 3%
00:57:27.039 and we want to have 3 million Bears of
00:57:28.640 oil right produced domestically in the
00:57:30.720 United States but if you double click on
00:57:33.039 that if you look at the total energy
00:57:35.319 reserves in the United States they're
00:57:37.760 three times greater than the total
00:57:39.480 energy reserves of Saudi Arabia three
00:57:41.720 times across all forms so not just oil
00:57:44.119 if you oil not gas plus
00:57:45.880 coal if we actually go as Antonio said
00:57:49.280 towards an industrial policy that's
00:57:51.720 pro-energy where the incremental cost of
00:57:54.079 energy is effectively zero where we want
00:57:56.400 just a gross abundance of electrons
00:57:58.520 flowing in America for all the great
00:58:01.000 ideas that could pop up it is by
00:58:04.160 definition going to generate an enormous
00:58:06.760 amount of revenue for the federal
00:58:08.200 government and so I think having the
00:58:10.359 Sovereign wealth fund be the rainy day
00:58:12.760 fund if you will right that can Bank a
00:58:15.240 percentage of all of that I think starts
00:58:17.079 to do a lot of really good for the
00:58:19.440 long-term strategic guidance of the US
00:58:22.480 freberg what do you think here is this
00:58:24.319 something where we're making the
00:58:25.720 government too big and now we've got the
00:58:27.760 government competing with black rock and
00:58:29.480 seoa and Andre and harowitz and they're
00:58:32.039 going to be on the board of technology
00:58:34.079 companies and energy companies and
00:58:35.680 investing in it and then what happens
00:58:37.400 when you know Obama Biden Trump Bush you
00:58:41.039 get different people running these
00:58:42.480 things and then they want to do their
00:58:43.760 pet projects it seems to me like this
00:58:45.400 could be get awfully conflicted awfully
00:58:47.240 quick what do you think should this be a
00:58:49.319 business or government's in I think one
00:58:51.680 of the things the government sucks at is
00:58:53.440 capitalism so I wouldn't make capitalis
00:58:56.440 the Mandate of a sovereign wealth fund
00:58:58.680 certainly not when we have $4 trillion
00:59:00.760 of federal debt it doesn't make economic
00:59:02.599 sense our cost of capital is 5% that's
00:59:05.119 how much the interest is on this 10 to
00:59:07.880 30e debt right now so it's very hard to
00:59:11.039 actually make real risk adjusted returns
00:59:13.640 when our cost of capital is so high so I
00:59:15.559 don't think the Mandate should be hey
00:59:16.880 let's put a bunch of capital in a pool
00:59:18.760 go and invest it and try and make money
00:59:20.359 for the United States that seems silly
00:59:23.400 but my point about the government being
00:59:25.039 really bad at capital is is that the
00:59:26.920 United States government owns and has
00:59:30.079 access to and will acquire through other
00:59:32.400 means significant assets and resources
00:59:35.599 that should be monetized in a smarter
00:59:37.240 way and so I would kind of think about
00:59:39.160 the Sovereign wealth fund as being more
00:59:40.640 of a strategic vehicle for monetization
00:59:44.160 of high value government assets so for
00:59:46.319 example if Trump does actually negotiate
00:59:48.160 a 50% Equity position in Tik Tock us
00:59:51.240 that needs to sit somewhere it should
00:59:53.039 not sit in the department of whatever it
00:59:55.720 should sit with a capitalist manager
00:59:58.200 that then ultimately makes the decision
00:59:59.640 on when and how to monetize that asset
01:00:02.000 return that cash to the treasury and pay
01:00:03.920 down the debt similarly the US has large
01:00:06.720 amounts of land has access to other
01:00:10.000 large assets that get transferred in
01:00:12.119 seizures etc etc so you know I don't
01:00:14.400 know if you guys remember all this but
01:00:15.520 there was like bit Bitcoin seizures that
01:00:17.680 have happened over the years is the
01:00:19.680 government has cracked down on criminal
01:00:21.039 Enterprises then the government owns
01:00:22.319 this Bitcoin do you think the smartest
01:00:24.039 people are making the decisions on where
01:00:25.559 and how to sell down that Bitcoin I
01:00:27.440 guarantee you not I would much rather
01:00:28.839 have a capitalist making that decision
01:00:30.720 so I would view the you know the The
01:00:32.599 Sovereign wealth fund being less about
01:00:34.319 raise capital from other means in the
01:00:35.920 government which effectively means
01:00:37.119 borrowing money through treasuries
01:00:38.920 because of the the debt level we have
01:00:40.799 and trying to invest it and much more
01:00:43.039 being about okay what strategic assets
01:00:45.200 can the US government monetize and use
01:00:47.400 this as the mechanism for doing that and
01:00:49.559 then ultimately I think the objective
01:00:51.079 should be to return that capital I I do
01:00:53.400 think there's also an opportunity for
01:00:54.839 managing
01:00:56.440 Social Security in a smarter way so
01:00:58.559 Social Security's functionally going to
01:01:00.599 be bankrupt in eight years the way the
01:01:03.160 trust is set up the cash that's there
01:01:05.680 the assets that are there and the demand
01:01:07.760 on Social Security given the Aging
01:01:09.960 population and the rising payouts every
01:01:12.920 year so one of the other ways to think
01:01:15.319 about this is what are the long-term
01:01:17.000 debt obligations which is ultimately the
01:01:18.599 point of these Sovereign wealth funds
01:01:20.640 and can they be invest in a smarter way
01:01:21.960 why is the Social Security entities
01:01:23.640 ultimately owning you know 3% yielding
01:01:26.000 bonds when they could be owning interest
01:01:28.520 in in equities so I would kind of think
01:01:31.000 about that strategic pool of capital
01:01:33.240 being managed by this as well and less
01:01:35.559 about the Mandate of go be a capitalist
01:01:37.839 investor for the United States raise
01:01:39.839 money and make money I think leave that
01:01:41.799 to the markets but when it comes to
01:01:43.400 strategic assets I think this could be a
01:01:44.920 good vehicle for when the got shut down
01:01:48.240 yeah we seized 144,000 Bitcoin and
01:01:51.880 that's sitting somewhere in some
01:01:53.640 Department of Justice off yeah they sold
01:01:56.520 I I think they sold sold it yeah no I
01:01:58.839 think we still have it I think that was
01:02:00.520 like the idea was that was going to
01:02:01.760 become the Bitcoin Str Reserve I mean
01:02:03.559 you could also come up with the doj the
01:02:06.240 doj sells these so like who do you think
01:02:08.240 of the doj is making the Bitcoin Market
01:02:10.160 decisions and is that the right person
01:02:12.119 to be monetizing these assets I mean d
01:02:14.720 made an interesting point security I I
01:02:16.359 just want to follow up on which
01:02:17.920 is when when you think about social
01:02:21.079 security it's six uh $6 trli of our 36
01:02:24.760 TR debt and it's actually a fake
01:02:26.559 treasury bill so just to one of the
01:02:29.200 things we figured out in early days
01:02:31.720 before the inauguration I is like that 6
01:02:33.760 trillion dollar sits on The Ledger it's
01:02:35.079 just a paper Ledger over so actually if
01:02:37.039 it gets paid out it's also be very
01:02:38.160 inflationary it's just a fake treasury
01:02:39.720 got ledged over at that pays a very low
01:02:41.920 rate and here at valer with my partners
01:02:44.920 John shulin has been reading to try to
01:02:47.559 help the the only the only thing we find
01:02:49.440 that's audit in the government the the
01:02:51.079 Social Security Administration actually
01:02:52.400 has an audit it has an audit and when
01:02:54.920 you go through the audit it's crazy the
01:02:57.079 material weaknesses going by to Doge
01:02:58.799 that you find yeah it' be way better to
01:03:01.400 have that invested in a way that was
01:03:02.559 economic for people with real money by
01:03:05.039 way as for this guys as we're speaking
01:03:08.319 the federal judge just put a temporary
01:03:10.720 restraining order on Doge and has barred
01:03:13.799 Elon and his team from accessing US
01:03:15.480 Treasury payments data all right so now
01:03:19.400 we're gonna
01:03:20.640 have a real grudge match between the
01:03:24.480 public the Federal which judge was it
01:03:26.480 federal judge federal judge yeah would
01:03:28.359 you know why jamat do it say why no but
01:03:31.119 Elizabeth Warren is doing a Victory lap
01:03:34.160 so I'm sure that you
01:03:36.160 know she's part of it so the government
01:03:38.880 agency set up by the president can't
01:03:40.760 look at
01:03:41.880 the database of the treasury so just to
01:03:45.400 be u double click here
01:03:47.760 doge is not a new agency it's the
01:03:50.319 renaming of existing agency I can't
01:03:51.760 remember the name of it we def find it
01:03:53.079 Elon tweeted about this uh some weeks
01:03:54.960 ago
01:03:56.720 that was set up under Obama actually to
01:04:00.359 do this to accredit an audit function to
01:04:02.200 the government what's crazy about this
01:04:04.200 ruling to me is uh Congress basically is
01:04:08.599 the Constitution delegates to to the
01:04:09.839 executive the um the ability to spend
01:04:12.160 the money and they go through Congress
01:04:13.640 it gets actually appropriate in Congress
01:04:14.839 and the executive spends it how can you
01:04:17.319 spend money if you don't know where it
01:04:19.160 went I how can you be responsible right
01:04:21.200 you have the authority to spend it but
01:04:22.319 not the and how can you responsibly
01:04:23.839 spend it if you actually can't go look
01:04:25.480 and see where it goes guys this is
01:04:27.599 flying Fast and Furious president Trump
01:04:29.839 just unveiled his framework for his tax
01:04:33.279 plan no tax on tips no tax on senior
01:04:36.680 social security no tax on overtime pay
01:04:39.400 renew the middle class tax cuts adjust
01:04:42.000 the salt cap so again very Pro as I said
01:04:44.839 Pro labor Pro populist eliminate all
01:04:47.400 special tax breaks for billionaire
01:04:48.960 sports team owners oh all right I'm no
01:04:51.640 longer I already sold a team I already
01:04:53.599 sold my fees I already sold my fees
01:04:57.359 oops oops close the carried interest
01:05:01.119 close the carried interest tax deduction
01:05:03.359 loophole which allowed you to claim
01:05:04.920 carried interest as sorry
01:05:07.599 Antonio I better run oh no I'll be back
01:05:11.000 in a few hours it's sell some
01:05:15.079 things isn't that incredible I mean he
01:05:17.359 is really going for the jugular
01:05:19.640 wow amazing I support this 100% the Suk
01:05:23.440 deductions coming back is that right
01:05:25.799 marginally though I don't think he's
01:05:26.960 going to give it the way that it was
01:05:28.079 before but isn't this incredible I
01:05:31.160 mean how who's going to stand up and lay
01:05:34.000 on the railroad tracks for being able to
01:05:37.240 amortise a multi-billion dollar sports
01:05:39.440 team purchase or that when you make a
01:05:42.520 fund investment you should get long-term
01:05:44.359 kept gains treatment who is going to be
01:05:46.160 that person in this ad nobody's going to
01:05:48.599 stand up for these things I think we
01:05:50.119 should just stop doing Ventra and just
01:05:52.240 start NOS we just start a whole Rats
01:05:54.839 nness of NOS to ship money around you
01:05:57.880 could have an incubator yeah absolutely
01:06:00.440 incubator incubator come if you've got a
01:06:02.880 great idea for an NGO why why didn't you
01:06:05.960 launch launch in every single random
01:06:08.400 developing country in the world I mean
01:06:10.480 if I had known you would have had 8
01:06:12.720 billion of AUM because of a USA ID just
01:06:15.480 launch one in Vietnam and we could have
01:06:18.880 yeah I could launch go launch I love it
01:06:21.599 we we could have had a yeah a launch
01:06:23.359 accelerator in Vietnam for transgender
01:06:26.440 yeah the Jason calanis launch fun of
01:06:28.720 Equatorial
01:06:31.000 Guinea it is so crazy though to come out
01:06:35.520 and you know watching the Democrats just
01:06:38.920 the self-own of coming out and being
01:06:40.920 like we have to stop people from
01:06:44.039 stopping wasteful spend like they just
01:06:46.160 don't seem to understand how unpopular
01:06:50.119 these are kitchen table issues like Rah
01:06:51.680 said I mean everyone cares about that
01:06:53.599 and if you don't care about that if you
01:06:54.640 care about these Fring isues and not the
01:06:56.640 things people care about on the kitchen
01:06:57.760 table well and if you think about the
01:07:01.400 transgender Sports issue biological
01:07:04.559 males playing in female sports leagues
01:07:08.119 that issue that Trump just did an EO
01:07:09.920 yesterday for was such an obvious issue
01:07:13.079 of fairness and just has nothing to do
01:07:15.839 with transgender it just has to do with
01:07:17.559 like biology if a if a biological male
01:07:21.680 plays basketball on a on a a biological
01:07:24.839 female team some somebody's going to get
01:07:26.039 hurt and that person's going to score
01:07:27.559 100 points it's just obvious and the
01:07:30.799 fact that the Democrats couldn't see
01:07:32.920 that issue being 100% for or
01:07:37.960 95% makes no sense like it's just such
01:07:40.799 an obvious litus test of logic I mean
01:07:44.599 look man the Constitution is is a is a
01:07:46.799 document about fairness the people that
01:07:48.839 found this country the Patriots found
01:07:50.559 this country they they did it cuz they
01:07:51.880 treated unfilly at home all of us here
01:07:54.400 um are one generation away right or two
01:07:56.480 generations away from immigration and
01:07:58.359 the reality is that's why people come
01:07:59.520 here man it's it's unamerican it's un
01:08:01.520 amican deg we got two people here who
01:08:03.319 are immigrants yes I'm reading the TR
01:08:05.880 and it looks like this TR means
01:08:07.520 temporary restraining order and it and
01:08:09.200 it's actually Narrows who from Doge yeah
01:08:13.680 can get read access down to two people
01:08:15.599 Tom kuss and Marco
01:08:17.600 elz oh okay so they don't want to have
01:08:22.799 the whole team be able to see what's at
01:08:24.479 treasury they just to have a process and
01:08:26.679 some sign off okay that sounds not
01:08:29.560 unreasonable I just want to point out
01:08:31.319 two people to to look at no matter how
01:08:33.839 good they are I'm she we're at 24/7 look
01:08:35.600 at all the payments in the US government
01:08:37.560 is not a lot yeah it does seem like it
01:08:39.279 needs to be more than two but it doesn't
01:08:41.040 seem like they're saying you can't look
01:08:42.719 at it they just want to have some
01:08:44.000 controls in
01:08:45.560 place I mean feels to me like that's an
01:08:47.679 administrative block that's like the
01:08:49.000 narrowest thing you could do two okay
01:08:51.238 yeah you can come in but you can just
01:08:52.439 send two people and just these two
01:08:54.839 people so if they get sick or something
01:08:56.439 happens no one else comes in that seems
01:08:58.880 to me to be truly dis mystery block to
01:09:00.960 slow it
01:09:01.880 down yeah H well we're interpreting this
01:09:04.880 in real time the facts will come out
01:09:06.719 over time let's wrap up on uh Google
01:09:09.439 Google dropped 7% after reporting
01:09:11.880 earnings on Tuesday chath Revenue up 12%
01:09:14.640 year-over-year to 96.5 billion wow Cloud
01:09:18.600 revenue is up 30% year-over-year 12
01:09:20.960 billion YouTube ads surging 14% to 10.5
01:09:24.920 billion net profit was around 26.5
01:09:28.560 billion up 28% year-over-year so they
01:09:30.960 are really focusing on profitability
01:09:33.799 obviously full year numbers this is just
01:09:36.359 extraordinary total revenue 350 billion
01:09:39.198 with a 100 billion in net profit cloud
01:09:42.600 and YouTube finished 2024 with a
01:09:44.439 combined run rate of $110 Billion
01:09:47.719 YouTube is basically Netflix inside of
01:09:50.040 uh inside of Google and their Google
01:09:52.319 cloud is essentially AWS inside of
01:09:55.040 Google
01:09:56.679 the thing that made investors get
01:09:58.560 concerned shth is that Google said it
01:10:00.640 would invest 75 billion in capex in
01:10:04.760 2025 42% jump over 2024 29% more than
01:10:09.199 analysts expect obviously this has to do
01:10:11.679 with data center servers and the AI
01:10:14.640 buildout what do you think about that
01:10:16.840 number 75 billion obviously in relation
01:10:20.800 to what we saw with deep seek doing it
01:10:24.159 with maybe a little bit less maybe
01:10:25.920 they're lying is this just an
01:10:30.280 absolute waste of money or gargantuan
01:10:32.960 number or is it something they can
01:10:35.239 easily with that amount of profitability
01:10:36.840 and cash they have absorb and use in the
01:10:38.880 future I think I should stipulate that
01:10:40.520 Google's models are probably the best of
01:10:42.960 all the models across a broad base
01:10:45.320 of capabilities if you test for them and
01:10:49.159 so let's start there which is whatever
01:10:51.280 they're doing is working the thing that
01:10:53.520 they need to do is be able to translate
01:10:55.480 those models now into better
01:10:58.239 products and I think that that will
01:11:00.560 happen slowly like for example if you
01:11:02.600 look at Deep
01:11:03.960 research most of the people online that
01:11:06.120 are evaluating deep research would now
01:11:07.679 say that open AI is both faster and just
01:11:11.560 better on the margins all of these
01:11:13.640 things can be improved I don't think
01:11:15.000 that's a comment on the base model I
01:11:16.480 think it's a comment on post trining and
01:11:18.719 how they're attempting to productize
01:11:20.360 these things
01:11:22.080 so the other thing that Google has is a
01:11:24.920 money machine that directly benefits
01:11:27.360 from these Aid driven optimizations on
01:11:30.360 ad targeting the only other company that
01:11:32.920 has anywhere close to the same
01:11:34.800 credibility as meta so I think what both
01:11:37.520 of these two companies need to do is do
01:11:40.199 a better job of explaining how that 75
01:11:42.880 billion gets segregated how much of that
01:11:45.199 goes to these AI enabled models that
01:11:47.960 actually do better ads optimization
01:11:49.639 there was a there was a really
01:11:51.000 interesting discussion by a former meta
01:11:52.840 machine learning engineer on X about how
01:11:54.600 they did it it's pretty amazing it's
01:11:56.679 staggering but if they could say half
01:11:58.760 the money goes to that and the other
01:12:00.239 half goes to more speculative you know
01:12:02.239 pre-training and post training I think
01:12:04.400 the market would have eaten it up so
01:12:07.760 it's probably more of a disclosure issue
01:12:09.400 for Google because I would say right now
01:12:10.760 their model quality is the
01:12:12.960 best you have thoughts on this buildout
01:12:15.679 Antonio obviously I think you've been
01:12:17.400 involved with xai uh and obviously
01:12:19.679 involved with Twitter and X previously
01:12:22.199 and colossus's colossal buildout that
01:12:24.719 was EX to watch a period of time do you
01:12:27.880 have concerns that like some people do
01:12:29.920 that this build out is too expensive and
01:12:32.280 would be too hard to monetize all that
01:12:35.760 expense or is it uh maybe a little bit
01:12:38.679 of hand ringing and the opportunity in
01:12:40.639 AI is so obviously huge that you just
01:12:43.600 got to take the leap of faith and and
01:12:45.280 and if you build it the revenue will
01:12:48.159 come yeah I think chath has the right
01:12:50.239 framework here which is return invest of
01:12:52.000 capital and what he's saying by you know
01:12:53.960 if Google had said hey half the money is
01:12:56.159 for ad and half the money is for much
01:12:57.520 bued post training the market would have
01:12:59.840 seen that half the money has a higher
01:13:01.000 return of capital and goog's return of
01:13:02.639 capital is actually going up uh after
01:13:04.920 the impation of of AI models into their
01:13:07.040 into their company and I I think that
01:13:08.960 sort of abstracts the entire Market
01:13:10.440 which is people are waking up that
01:13:13.159 return invested capital in data s will
01:13:14.679 matter that the models are basic
01:13:16.480 Commodities and super competitive in the
01:13:19.440 best case it's kind of a a land worn
01:13:21.120 Asia it's a melee in in a worst case
01:13:23.239 just total Commodities what does matter
01:13:25.639 is the return on Capital data center
01:13:27.880 which is influenced by how good the data
01:13:29.400 centers are so you mention the X data
01:13:31.880 center it's 100,000 GP cluster it's the
01:13:34.159 most dense coherent cluster in the world
01:13:36.320 and it will just train faster and better
01:13:38.360 than other clusters and it's also built
01:13:40.920 for the most cheaply and the fastest so
01:13:44.000 XI will have the highest train on
01:13:45.159 Capital and I also think the best train
01:13:46.719 data and therefore will win I think
01:13:48.080 Google will also win because they have U
01:13:50.719 their tensor flow chips they make their
01:13:52.560 own some of their own chips they do
01:13:54.520 focus on RC and they have a great
01:13:57.000 Monopoly to kind of fund it all so I
01:13:59.120 don't think it's over blown I think that
01:14:00.520 I think this is going to be as you guys
01:14:01.480 have said before in the podcast you know
01:14:02.800 bigger than Industrial Revolution but uh
01:14:05.639 it's also true that you need to have a
01:14:08.560 good roic and if you don't you're not
01:14:10.800 transparent about it you can see what
01:14:12.000 happens I I would argue Google's
01:14:14.800 probably been the most frugal thoughtful
01:14:17.920 and well-managed Computing
01:14:19.520 infrastructure investor of all time you
01:14:22.120 know the 98 to 2005 era Google it was
01:14:25.239 all about just cheap throwaway racks
01:14:27.400 that that was the big Advantage they had
01:14:28.880 is they weren't using the expensive
01:14:30.159 Oracle servers and they had a two to
01:14:33.159 three-year kind of depreciation timeline
01:14:35.480 on those but they were super cheap and
01:14:37.520 so the the roic was quite good then they
01:14:40.560 got into Energy Efficiency which they
01:14:42.199 realized was a big driving cost they
01:14:43.719 started to build systems that that were
01:14:46.040 more energy efficient as a result they
01:14:47.560 lasted
01:14:48.679 longer and then their their depreciation
01:14:51.320 schedule moved up to 3 to four years
01:14:53.320 meaning they could kind of write down
01:14:54.600 the value of the servers over 3 to four
01:14:56.600 years and then from 2010 to 2015 era
01:15:00.520 their Hardware system for cloud allowed
01:15:04.840 them to kind of extend through
01:15:06.600 repurposing the utilization and they
01:15:08.760 increased their depreciation from to
01:15:10.520 four to five years and then in 2021 I
01:15:12.920 don't know if you guys remember this
01:15:13.840 they made this kind of big change to
01:15:15.199 their depreciation schedule on data
01:15:18.320 center infrastructure to six years so
01:15:20.400 when they invest capex in a data center
01:15:23.760 they would write down the servers over a
01:15:25.199 six-year cycle because of AI
01:15:26.800 optimization on maintenance so they he
01:15:28.360 started using AI just for internal
01:15:31.040 management of the infrastructure so I
01:15:33.520 would view the $75 billion capex
01:15:37.159 actually as a very positive signal for
01:15:39.679 the company I think that it means that
01:15:41.960 they have a really strong line of sight
01:15:43.760 on how they're going to have full
01:15:45.639 utilization and great return on this if
01:15:48.040 you do the math Ric math on this $75
01:15:50.520 billion assume a 20% roic you've got to
01:15:55.120 generating call it roughly an
01:15:56.679 incremental $15 billion of profit a year
01:16:00.000 plus the amortization of the 75 billion
01:16:02.360 so take the 75 billion divided by six
01:16:04.840 that's 12 billion plus 15 billion so
01:16:07.040 what they're so basically they would
01:16:08.600 need to make an incremental 27 billion
01:16:10.440 of operating profit a year on the 75
01:16:13.320 billion for this to meet their roic
01:16:15.800 performance that doesn't seem crazy
01:16:17.400 because that's just under 20% of their
01:16:19.080 in of their annual operating profit this
01:16:21.040 is a very kind of I think important
01:16:22.760 point which is Google doesn't just do
01:16:25.239 this to to build out AI in the future
01:16:27.760 they have a really strong line of sight
01:16:29.120 on how this can kind of increment and
01:16:30.440 you don't have a huge hurdle for them
01:16:32.159 for this to pay back so I don't know I
01:16:34.320 would kind of take Antonio's point I'd
01:16:35.800 view this as a positive I think if you
01:16:37.320 use their historical ability to manage
01:16:39.679 infrastructure and make predictions on
01:16:41.280 Investments as an indicator of the
01:16:43.120 future this is a strong and positive
01:16:45.120 indicator and I do think that for all
01:16:47.000 the naysayers out there that think that
01:16:48.480 search is going to evolve to chat you
01:16:50.560 could look at this as being a really
01:16:52.000 important proof point that Google has
01:16:53.880 the confidence that they're going to be
01:16:54.960 able to move from search to chat and as
01:16:57.440 jamat points out they've got great
01:16:58.960 performative models and I would view
01:17:00.760 this more of as a positive than a
01:17:02.000 negative if they were under investing I
01:17:03.520 would be worried that they didn't know
01:17:04.560 where to invest but to see them make
01:17:06.280 this degree of investment highlights the
01:17:07.679 confidence in the strategy and turny I
01:17:10.280 don't know if you've been watching the
01:17:11.360 agent space or deep research that came
01:17:13.719 out from Google and then closed AI I
01:17:16.639 mean open AI launched their copycat
01:17:18.960 version of this product sorry I don't
01:17:22.040 short feelings on it I'm curious your
01:17:24.440 thoughts on on job displacement we're
01:17:27.360 looking at self-driving obviously wh's
01:17:29.719 got cars on the road obviously uh Tesla
01:17:32.000 which you were previously on the board
01:17:33.400 of and I know you were the First
01:17:35.199 Institutional Investor in Tesla self-
01:17:38.000 driving is pretty good I only get like
01:17:39.520 one or two disengagements per hour and
01:17:42.000 they tend to be the ones where I just
01:17:43.480 want to take the turn a little sharper
01:17:44.960 kind of thing so that's getting pretty
01:17:46.239 close byd is very close you got a A lot
01:17:50.440 of job displacement that aocc millions
01:17:52.520 and millions of drivers in 10 years
01:17:55.000 could lose their jobs researchers
01:17:58.080 working at Gartner Group whatever Boston
01:18:00.880 Consultant Group like it feels like
01:18:02.960 there could be massive job displacement
01:18:05.440 do you have concerns about that in the
01:18:07.320 American economy and globally there's a
01:18:09.320 lot of hand ring about this and it's
01:18:10.800 real in Prior moments of LW disruption
01:18:15.040 that there have been uh job
01:18:16.360 displacements because there's you know
01:18:17.480 generous people get retrained for
01:18:18.679 something else you can't retrain so you
01:18:20.480 know I think uh there were studies mon
01:18:22.239 fre did of the steel industry in
01:18:24.080 Pittsburgh in the '70s that the cost of
01:18:27.639 each steel worker job loss was about a
01:18:29.560 million dollars to the economy because
01:18:30.920 these people couldn't be retrained and
01:18:32.520 that might happen here but I'm going I
01:18:34.040 have a more benign Outlook personally
01:18:36.960 what I think is going to happen is that
01:18:38.560 you will have job loss uh but the amount
01:18:41.280 of productivity that will be released in
01:18:42.960 the US economy is going to be
01:18:44.600 extraordinary right so so GDP growth is
01:18:47.520 a function of the numberal people
01:18:48.600 working times productivity it's very
01:18:50.520 simple economists want to make it more
01:18:52.639 complex than that but it's the number of
01:18:53.880 people working times productivity
01:18:55.920 if you go if prty goes up to 5 6 7 8%
01:18:59.840 you get a massive boost in GDP growth
01:19:02.880 and then what happens well people can
01:19:05.000 get retrained they can get different
01:19:06.639 jobs different Services happen people
01:19:08.639 start companies the application layer of
01:19:11.320 LMS is just starting the the barrier to
01:19:13.639 start a company is quite low things like
01:19:15.639 launch probably explode because there's
01:19:17.320 all these people who have don't have
01:19:18.520 jobs anywh that were accountants and
01:19:19.719 want to start something it's hard to
01:19:21.400 know what happens you know I believe in
01:19:22.880 American agility I believe in in this
01:19:24.960 country I believe that we will figure
01:19:26.840 out figure out a way that make this all
01:19:28.400 work and if there's enough productivity
01:19:30.120 and money in the economy that's flowing
01:19:32.360 people will find new jobs they will find
01:19:35.120 new business to start they will find new
01:19:36.520 things to do we have to get out of the
01:19:37.960 way take regulation down and let
01:19:40.080 Americans be creative and unleash the
01:19:42.480 American productivity machine Let's make
01:19:45.040 that happen yeah that's I think really
01:19:47.719 strong thoughts and I mean that's the
01:19:49.320 game we're seeing on the field how many
01:19:50.920 companies are we seeing hit a million
01:19:52.520 dollars in Revenue with five employees
01:19:54.480 where that used to take yeah 25 so the
01:19:57.480 efficiency is there trath your your
01:19:59.199 outlook on this issue since it seems to
01:20:01.280 be coming up again specifically with
01:20:03.280 truck drivers and Uber drivers and all
01:20:06.280 kinds of other research jobs that seem
01:20:09.040 to be be doing pretty well um or can be
01:20:11.719 done pretty well by AI where where do
01:20:14.000 you stand on this issue today I think
01:20:15.800 it's a process Buffett wrote about this
01:20:18.080 in an annual letter and what he
01:20:20.159 described was the changing nature of
01:20:23.080 jobs during The Agrarian
01:20:26.239 Revolution and what you saw was a large
01:20:29.000 cohort of people who supported
01:20:31.679 themselves through
01:20:32.760 farming and then the total Quantum of
01:20:36.120 those jobs shrank by 90% when you had
01:20:38.600 industrialized farming and tractors and
01:20:41.600 whatnot but the economy to Antonio's
01:20:44.080 Point grew around that business and
01:20:45.760 added other kinds of businesses that
01:20:47.880 didn't make sense in that moment and I
01:20:50.159 think what you see is that when
01:20:52.520 economies get more and more evolved you
01:20:54.880 see the growth of services businesses
01:20:57.920 that sort of are these things that can
01:20:59.960 only happen when you have excess right
01:21:03.000 the person that you pay for closet
01:21:04.440 organizing would not have had a job in
01:21:06.520 the turn of the agrarian Revolution or
01:21:09.280 the Industrial Revolution but they can
01:21:11.239 they can exist in 202 something and
01:21:13.000 frankly they can make a good job the
01:21:14.360 life coach there are all these jobs that
01:21:16.159 just kind of come out of nowhere
01:21:17.600 podcaster influencer all of that Venture
01:21:20.400 venture capitalist vure Capital
01:21:22.880 allocator absolutely
01:21:25.120 mutant strawberry Creator yeah so I
01:21:27.679 think that I think that you're cut that
01:21:30.400 waiting for this next turn of creativity
01:21:33.800 like the big problem that we all have
01:21:36.280 maybe I'll take the more glass half
01:21:38.000 empty version of what Antonio said is we
01:21:40.600 really haven't been unlocking people's
01:21:42.840 creativity over the last 15 years we've
01:21:45.520 been trundling around except safe of a
01:21:48.920 few companies which we all know and we
01:21:50.560 can just repeat them endlessly but we
01:21:52.239 know which ones they are that are truly
01:21:54.560 innovating and at the edge everybody
01:21:57.159 else is kind of diddling around Naval
01:22:00.000 casing so the real problem is that we
01:22:02.560 have not had a lot of reps in being
01:22:04.040 creative I'll give you just a very
01:22:05.840 simple example Nick can you find this
01:22:08.360 even extremely state industries did you
01:22:10.400 see the byd clip of the car that and I
01:22:14.560 thought myself Park yes with a little
01:22:16.880 swipe it's how tragic is it that you
01:22:21.280 look at this and you're blown away yeah
01:22:24.080 and you're blown blown away for two
01:22:25.239 reasons one is a I didn't think that
01:22:28.159 that was possible and B why doesn't it
01:22:31.120 exist in America but the reality
01:22:33.520 underneath the hood is extremely benign
01:22:36.600 how this is
01:22:37.800 implemented and so I think that the
01:22:39.920 problem is we spent so much
01:22:42.360 time losing the
01:22:44.840 script I think Antonio is right when you
01:22:47.360 unshackle people to not focus on the
01:22:50.440 mental load of getting the pronouns
01:22:52.320 right or the this or the that
01:22:55.440 you won't be so overwhelmed by things
01:22:58.239 like this because you will have already
01:22:59.520 been pushing the boundaries of human
01:23:00.920 creativity we need to get back to that
01:23:02.600 we need to let these creative people
01:23:04.280 cook and I hope I hope that that happens
01:23:07.440 and I think that that will happen
01:23:09.159 freeberg can you do a science corner on
01:23:11.800 the FDA approval for the nonopioid
01:23:14.520 painkiller right not today no no I know
01:23:17.440 but could you do it like in a couple
01:23:18.760 weeks
01:23:20.320 yeah by the one I wanted to do is that
01:23:23.400 new macro study on gp1s which I think is
01:23:26.719 super interesting oh tell us you guys
01:23:29.360 remember I talked a while ago about how
01:23:31.639 they were able to mine VA data so the VA
01:23:34.560 right they they take care of veterans
01:23:37.000 and they have all the medical records
01:23:39.400 and on an anonymized basis they can make
01:23:41.800 that data available to researchers and
01:23:43.960 so if you guys remember this this is how
01:23:45.400 they identified that the Epstein bar
01:23:47.159 virus or the virus that causes mono as
01:23:49.400 being statistically certain to be the
01:23:51.120 trigger for multiple sclerosis in the
01:23:53.040 cohort of hundreds of thousands of
01:23:54.880 patients that were in this this data set
01:23:58.679 no
01:23:59.960 one got Ms that didn't get Epstein bar
01:24:03.400 virus if you did not get Epstein bar
01:24:05.360 virus you did not get Ms I don't know if
01:24:07.400 you guys remember I did the science
01:24:08.360 Corner a while ago anyway so the data
01:24:10.080 set that you can mine at the VA is
01:24:11.560 incredible so they pulled all the data
01:24:13.719 from everyone that's been on the gp1
01:24:15.320 agonists and they identified all of the
01:24:17.560 health effects across multiple
01:24:18.960 indications the statistical difference
01:24:20.520 between the cohorts okay so this
01:24:22.400 research team out of St Louis pulled all
01:24:25.760 the data from the VA database and
01:24:28.679 basically they looked at you know 1.2
01:24:30.760 million people with diabetes that didn't
01:24:32.679 take anything compared to 215,000 that
01:24:36.560 took the glp1 receptor agonists and
01:24:39.360 another 600,000 people that took other
01:24:41.520 drugs for diabetes so basically this
01:24:45.679 cohort
01:24:47.280 segmentation allows them to isolate the
01:24:49.800 effect of the glp1 drugs um and as you
01:24:52.880 can see here this shows across hundreds
01:24:55.600 of thousands of patients the effect of
01:24:57.320 the glp1 on a hazard ratio which means
01:25:00.040 like How likely are you to have the
01:25:01.960 following health condition versus the
01:25:04.400 population that's not taking the glp
01:25:06.239 ones and then uh on the right if you
01:25:09.080 scroll to the right Nick are the
01:25:11.239 increase in risk and on the left are the
01:25:13.239 things that go down so the increase the
01:25:15.159 only thing that increased is like you
01:25:16.520 know 8% or 10% increase in nausea and
01:25:19.040 vomiting y confirm uh musculoskeletal
01:25:22.920 complications grd which is you know
01:25:25.199 gastric reflux from sleep indigestion
01:25:30.159 yeah and sleep disturbances related to
01:25:31.840 indigestion so it's all abdominal stuff
01:25:33.760 now if you go over here to the benefit
01:25:35.840 side so the benefit side is what
01:25:38.400 conditions did you see a decrease in so
01:25:40.480 you have a decrease in shock a decrease
01:25:42.719 in uh he hepatic failure so liver
01:25:45.119 failure respiratory failure cardiac
01:25:48.040 arrest in fact on cardiac arrest you see
01:25:50.639 a 30% decrease in the probability of
01:25:52.880 having cardiac arrest from the cohort
01:25:55.480 that's on the
01:25:57.040 glp1 Bia wow schizophrenia so so this
01:26:01.719 goes to the point if you guys remember
01:26:03.199 the interview I did a couple months ago
01:26:05.159 with the CEO of Eli Lily that they have
01:26:07.360 all these clinical trials going on right
01:26:09.920 now for different indications for the
01:26:11.520 glp1 receptor agonists that they're
01:26:13.239 seeing that there's health benefits
01:26:15.080 Beyond just the weight loss in reducing
01:26:17.840 things like kidney disease obviously
01:26:19.600 liver problems mental problems and so on
01:26:22.000 do we know why and and if we don't know
01:26:25.679 why do you think it's
01:26:27.639 because this is suppressing the food and
01:26:29.960 it's the the lack of food or the change
01:26:32.080 in the food consumption that's creating
01:26:33.800 this do you know what I'm asking like do
01:26:35.320 you think the drug is actually yeah y so
01:26:38.000 um you should watch the interview I did
01:26:40.040 with RS in fact this is a good moment to
01:26:41.840 call it out if you Haven seen it yeah I
01:26:43.960 think he highlights that this class of
01:26:45.920 drugs there are you know genes get
01:26:48.080 turned on and off so there's a you know
01:26:50.119 what's called a gene expression Cascade
01:26:52.719 that occurs with certain compounds so we
01:26:55.920 know that the gp1 receptor Agonist means
01:26:58.760 that it binds to these gp1 sites and
01:27:00.800 there's a cascading effect of genes that
01:27:03.280 then get expressed and what that seems
01:27:05.280 to do is turn off things like
01:27:07.080 inflammatory markers it turns on things
01:27:09.480 like C two genes which can actually
01:27:11.679 increase cellular repair so there seem
01:27:13.719 to be other benefits from these drugs
01:27:15.440 Beyond just the appetite control and
01:27:17.159 it's not the appetite control itself but
01:27:19.520 there seems to be other effects let me
01:27:21.080 ask you a question from these these
01:27:22.679 receptors being activated you put your
01:27:25.480 kids on this no okay would you put your
01:27:29.679 wife on this I would consider it and I
01:27:32.639 would consider it for myself too just
01:27:34.159 for the anti-inflammatory effects how
01:27:36.560 will you make that decision well for me
01:27:38.880 personally and the thing that I weigh
01:27:40.480 against is the muscle loss and uh the
01:27:43.159 the bone density loss so I think that if
01:27:45.360 you look at the the biggest kind of
01:27:46.719 effect on these on a on the downside
01:27:48.639 basis is you should increase your
01:27:50.880 protein in your diet you have to do
01:27:52.520 weightlifting there's things that you
01:27:54.280 would do and frankly if you do those
01:27:55.920 things anyway if you increase protein in
01:27:57.520 your diet and do more weightlifting
01:27:59.440 you're actually going to see very good
01:28:00.760 health benefits from just doing those
01:28:02.440 things that may actually outweigh the
01:28:04.119 benefits you get the I have a question
01:28:06.679 you Dave which is and this is the
01:28:07.600 question is when when you look at that
01:28:08.840 data and you talk to the
01:28:10.920 cosos how much you think really longterm
01:28:13.600 when the longterm sies are out is going
01:28:14.800 to be that it was the drug or just that
01:28:17.320 being obese is very bad for you and so
01:28:19.920 when you take your body fat down
01:28:21.440 dramatically all these other Gene
01:28:23.159 Expressions happen anyway right so you
01:28:25.080 think which one will it well this is
01:28:26.320 this is what they're starting to isolate
01:28:27.840 and I will say Antonio they are starting
01:28:29.760 to see that there are other Expressions
01:28:33.040 that are not related to the Obesity and
01:28:34.760 people that don't have obesity that
01:28:36.119 they're using that are using these drugs
01:28:37.800 so they're they're seeing that cohort
01:28:39.159 data now a clinical studies uh phase two
01:28:41.199 were published and I think we're going
01:28:42.800 to see phase three and some of these
01:28:44.440 indications soon but it is looking very
01:28:47.360 positive that it's not just the loss of
01:28:49.239 obesity now to your point being obese
01:28:52.159 not exercising eating poorly destroys
01:28:54.719 your health you stop that right right
01:28:57.119 everything gets better um if you lift
01:28:59.040 weights freeberg can you tell us when
01:29:00.960 you decide to do this I will yeah if I
01:29:02.960 if I do do a glp1 um receptor Agonist I
01:29:06.040 will let you guys know right now I'm I I
01:29:08.280 actually feel like I want to go through
01:29:10.159 a process of
01:29:11.840 increasing uh my weightlifting routine
01:29:13.960 more I I you know I've been trying to
01:29:16.440 create a more kind of rigorous my
01:29:17.920 schedule just sucks so that's been the
01:29:19.119 hardest thing for me but I actually want
01:29:20.679 to go through that first before making
01:29:22.159 that decision
01:29:24.159 cool David oh I'm sorry no I was just
01:29:26.280 curious why why that order I don't
01:29:28.199 understand I want to measure the effects
01:29:29.760 because I do think that if you actually
01:29:31.440 get into a a regular weightlifting
01:29:33.119 routine and you increase protein in your
01:29:35.440 diet which is another thing I've been
01:29:37.400 making a a concerted measured effort to
01:29:39.600 do which is hard as a vegetarian by the
01:29:42.920 way you see pretty significant uh health
01:29:46.119 effects and so I'm trying to get through
01:29:47.679 the process of increasing muscle
01:29:49.639 composition before I'll make the
01:29:51.239 decision on whether or not to add G one
01:29:52.840 I don't want to kind of confound the two
01:29:54.119 factors you know what I did that made it
01:29:55.960 super easy for me um is I got uh egg
01:29:59.080 whites in a carton and I have and I have
01:30:02.320 this incredible uh
01:30:04.560 crunchy spicy garlic thing that
01:30:07.440 everybody muku and everybody makes and
01:30:09.280 everybody's crazy about just in the
01:30:10.920 mornings I'll eat whatever it is 10
01:30:13.400 ounces 12 ounces of egg whites with that
01:30:16.000 spicy stuff it's delicious it's awesome
01:30:18.119 and I just try to you know get that
01:30:20.920 whatever 30 40 grams of protein first
01:30:22.960 thing in the morning and then doing the
01:30:25.239 rocking well this is is easy like you
01:30:27.600 just wear a 35 pound weight vest
01:30:29.600 freeberg and you walk a mile or two and
01:30:32.159 you will get like my problem Jason with
01:30:34.800 all of this is that every time I see
01:30:37.000 something so I saw Gary Brea on the Sha
01:30:39.040 Ryan podcast recently and Sean Ryan asks
01:30:43.119 him like what are a handful of things
01:30:45.199 that you recommend for everybody right
01:30:47.480 and he recommends mineral salt and then
01:30:49.119 he recommends a methylated vitamin he
01:30:51.320 recommends amino acids whatever there's
01:30:53.239 a protocol
01:30:54.639 then if you happen to catch a clip on X
01:30:56.280 of Andrew huberman he'll have a protocol
01:30:58.679 and then Brian Johnson has a protocol
01:31:01.360 and the problem is all these Protocols
01:31:03.639 are slightly the same but they're just
01:31:05.600 different enough where it creates a huge
01:31:07.440 cognitive load in a normal person like
01:31:09.360 myself to your point freeberg Who's busy
01:31:11.880 who's got a job who's got kids how do
01:31:14.600 you decide and so I would really love
01:31:18.280 something to be sort of like I don't
01:31:20.239 want to say gold standard because you
01:31:21.840 can't say that but that is like what's
01:31:24.679 the real bank for your buck what Antonio
01:31:27.320 said you know are you just better off
01:31:28.719 just losing the 50 pounds and then this
01:31:31.679 is why these products are successful and
01:31:33.719 I think will be continue to grow pretty
01:31:36.040 dramatically Antonio is because it is
01:31:38.080 pop a pill and it solves all those
01:31:39.800 problems it doesn't require a cognitive
01:31:41.600 load it will be in a pill format soon
01:31:43.880 right I mean the pills are almost here
01:31:46.400 it would be very cool actually DAV if
01:31:47.880 you do this U to jamar's point about you
01:31:50.360 know people being confused if you did
01:31:52.560 the every the every person's um kind of
01:31:55.560 story around this journey and you
01:31:58.280 documented itally you know like you you
01:31:59.760 did like this is my weight I did
01:32:01.000 weightlifting first and I did the gop1
01:32:02.760 and you actually did like a weekly thing
01:32:04.440 where you checked in and even it was 10
01:32:06.239 minutes up on X or something where you
01:32:07.880 just gave people the journey um in a way
01:32:11.360 that wasn't so complicated because I
01:32:12.960 think people are confused Jam right mean
01:32:14.400 I have I have very good doctors you guys
01:32:15.719 are good doctors but if you don't you
01:32:17.760 don't know what to do by the way that
01:32:19.480 the problem for me just to give you a
01:32:20.880 sense of it I had a doctor in LA I had a
01:32:24.239 doctor in San Francisco I would have
01:32:26.000 them do their own versions of things
01:32:27.520 then I would have somebody else help me
01:32:30.159 compare it cost me way too much money
01:32:32.400 and all that complexity did was make the
01:32:34.840 quality of my healthare actually go down
01:32:37.199 yeah and instead what I really wanted
01:32:38.800 was just a very simple protocol that
01:32:41.000 said take the metformin because it's
01:32:43.400 good for you take the vitamin D take the
01:32:45.520 omega-3 fatty acids otherwise just eat
01:32:47.560 this meal plan and it would help me a
01:32:50.239 lot more than than I've had to Cobble it
01:32:52.280 together myself because by the way when
01:32:53.920 you see something like you know Gary
01:32:55.199 Brea is very very articulate very smart
01:32:58.440 but when I see him on the Sha Ryan
01:32:59.719 podcast the first thing I do is I go and
01:33:02.040 populate an Amazon cart with all the
01:33:03.719 things that he said because my instinct
01:33:06.040 is well I should do the right thing for
01:33:07.560 myself this is a couple hundred bucks
01:33:09.280 it's worth the investment but then the
01:33:11.480 day after somebody else say something
01:33:13.880 else you know so I'll be really you have
01:33:16.159 a little OCD though Jamal I've known you
01:33:17.800 for a long time you get very obsessive
01:33:20.320 with my father died because of poor
01:33:22.320 health my best friend died of Po health
01:33:24.280 I feel like you you should at least do
01:33:27.600 the things that are preventable have you
01:33:29.679 guys seen that that post jat did with
01:33:31.320 you he was like half naked in the mirror

01:33:36.800 look like that you you'd do it too no no
01:33:38.760 no I'm talking about like when you had
01:33:40.239 the glucose monitor I'm sitting with him
01:33:42.320 at the poker table he's got the glucose
01:33:43.840 monitor and he's taking a sip of wine
01:33:45.880 he's checking the glucose he's Tak he's
01:33:48.000 having like a piece of BJ then he's
01:33:49.920 checking the glucose monitor it's just
01:33:52.280 like literally becomes upset

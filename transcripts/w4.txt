00:03:45.319 the White House give it to me it was
00:03:47.159 probably the most intense three days
00:03:51.640 that we had Nat and I were there to see
00:03:54.680 the president but obviously we were
00:03:56.040 there to see saaks as well but there was
00:03:58.560 a bunch of other things that happened
00:03:59.920 happened myself freeberg new money Sunny
00:04:03.360 was
00:04:04.280 there our bestie Elon Musk obviously we
00:04:06.920 dropped in with him so to recap on
00:04:09.920 Sunday we got in it was just like
00:04:11.360 raining cats of dogs nothing to say
00:04:12.959 there then on Monday what happened was
00:04:15.000 we basically had some meetings in the
00:04:17.320 morning and then David said guys let me
00:04:19.160 just walk you around and just show you
00:04:21.798 where I were by the way we camped out in
00:04:23.840 Sax's office for three days which was
00:04:27.080 awesome so we we had the passes to be
00:04:30.600 at the westwing in the Eisenhower
00:04:32.120 Building that's Sax's office and so we
00:04:34.520 all kind of worked from there and then
00:04:36.600 we went and did our meetings from Sax's
00:04:38.880 office and Sax's incredible Chief of
00:04:41.120 Staff Tracy escorted us around anytime
00:04:43.520 we needed to go anywhere so then we we
00:04:46.360 started to walk through the West Wing we
00:04:47.600 dropped by look at Sax's office for a
00:04:49.960 second I love what you've done with the
00:04:51.840 place were you allowed to put up a piece
00:04:54.120 of art and look at that desktop rig I
00:04:57.000 think the most iconic part of the West
00:05:00.039 is the Portico where you see that those
00:05:02.720 very famous shots of all these very
00:05:04.320 important people in this case it's just
00:05:06.400 the four of us but you can see Nick
00:05:09.320 there's the shot of all of us well the
00:05:10.960 Portico connects the West Wing to the
00:05:13.120 president's residence Tracy Sax's Chief
00:05:16.000 of Staff escorted us from The West Wing
00:05:18.280 after we did an amazing tour of the West
00:05:19.960 Wing over to the residents I don't know
00:05:22.000 if we were really supposed to do it but
00:05:23.800 she she has full access so we were able
00:05:25.720 to kind of go on the walk and then we
00:05:27.919 took a walk around the residence all the
00:05:30.199 rooms but this is the entrance to the
00:05:31.759 West Wing right here so when you come in
00:05:33.919 for for meetings administrators so we
00:05:35.759 walk in Pam Bond's on our way out we we
00:05:37.720 got to meet Pam Bondi I mean it really
00:05:39.680 is amazing like members of the cabinet
00:05:41.520 are coming in and out of this door
00:05:43.160 members at work in the West Wing are
00:05:44.520 coming or leaders yeah and then we saw
00:05:46.680 like leaders coming in one of the most
00:05:48.639 iconic things we were allowed to do was
00:05:50.880 see The Press Room by the way the people
00:05:53.199 that work and we'll get to it in a
00:05:54.680 second because we met some incredible
00:05:56.080 people that work in the white house but
00:05:57.919 some of the folks that don't necess
00:05:59.639 neily get a lot of flowers like folks
00:06:01.400 that work in like the upper press room
00:06:03.080 and the lower Press Room some of the
00:06:05.120 kindest people and what they did was
00:06:07.680 they're like oh guys why don't you come
00:06:08.960 and see where they do the presidential
00:06:10.919 briefings and the one thing about the
00:06:12.960 White House is everything is just like
00:06:14.919 in a nook and cranny away so this is
00:06:17.080 where obviously you see the presidential
00:06:18.560 seal isn't there because the president
00:06:20.000 is not there but we were able to do that
00:06:22.560 we met some really The Press Room here
00:06:24.560 this is the actual Press Room this is
00:06:26.599 the way it was just like a little door
00:06:28.639 it's so small it's a door off the side
00:06:30.680 this the whole West Wing is like
00:06:32.919 disarmingly small you can walk for 15
00:06:36.199 seconds between the Oval Office and
00:06:37.919 pretty much everywhere else in the west
00:06:39.319 wing it really is a very tight and
00:06:41.479 elon's got an office in there that we
00:06:43.039 got to kind of drop in and say hi the
00:06:45.440 president obviously chth went over to
00:06:47.080 the oval then there's the situation room
00:06:50.000 I mean everything is within a couple of
00:06:51.919 steps of everything and it really is
00:06:54.919 you're in these kind of historic moments
00:06:57.199 as you walk through this you just feel
00:06:59.199 the of everything that you've heard
00:07:00.960 about and seen and all the history and
00:07:03.280 Legacy to every everything and it's just
00:07:05.120 all right there compact in one space
00:07:08.639 you're just overwhelmed it really was
00:07:10.199 overwhelming for me emotionally it was
00:07:11.800 overwhelming intellectually you just
00:07:13.680 kind of walk around and you know it's
00:07:16.680 just you're you're part of it and it was
00:07:18.680 so I was telling shamat it was so
00:07:20.400 emotional for me at the end of the day
00:07:21.599 to just be like man like you come to
00:07:23.840 this country come to
00:07:25.360 America you know from wherever you came
00:07:28.039 from and anyone can find their way into
00:07:31.240 this historic space that's the beauty of
00:07:33.800 this country and I it never really hit
00:07:36.080 me until we were in this moment so let
00:07:39.000 me show you I kind of really got it me
00:07:40.560 some really incredible people Nick you
00:07:42.400 can find a picture of myself and
00:07:44.039 freeberg and sunny and saaks we're with
00:07:46.800 Taylor
00:07:47.720 budt who's David David he's a deputy
00:07:50.639 chief of staff Deputy Chief of Staff for
00:07:52.680 communications and the White House his
00:07:54.440 office is is well placed because through
00:07:56.240 that window behind us is the gaggle
00:07:59.759 there's this lawn out on the the White
00:08:02.680 House called Pebble Beach and all the
00:08:04.240 networks have tents there and they'll do
00:08:06.280 recordings with White House officials
00:08:08.039 and the White House will be in the
00:08:09.440 background it's not like a green screen
00:08:11.240 or an LED it's the actual White House
00:08:12.639 will be in the background that's why
00:08:13.800 it's all set up there and it's called
00:08:15.639 Pebble Beach and then there's an area I
00:08:18.360 think they call it like the sticks which
00:08:19.800 is basically just like a paved area
00:08:22.720 where White House officials can go out
00:08:24.000 there and they get swarmed by all the
00:08:26.000 media asking him questions that's called
00:08:27.680 the gagle so he can keep an eye on
00:08:29.599 everything that's happening with the
00:08:31.800 media through that window in his office
00:08:33.880 is that where Marine One lands and you
00:08:35.479 see everybody yelling at the president
00:08:37.200 and trying to like talk the cops or
00:08:39.120 that's on the other side that's on the
00:08:40.279 other side it's on the other side but a
00:08:42.120 lot of those reporters will just move
00:08:43.479 over there when they have theity to do
00:08:45.200 that but like when you see when you see
00:08:46.920 Caroline levit who's the White House
00:08:48.000 Press Secretary or Steven Miller who's
00:08:49.560 the yeah Deputy Chief of Staff for
00:08:50.920 policy they'll come out and all of a
00:08:52.440 sudden they're speaking in a microphone
00:08:53.839 it'll seem impromptu there'll be a lot
00:08:55.640 of reporters that's usually the the
00:08:57.839 sticks or and that's the the White House
00:08:59.839 Gaggle we saw Elon obviously Nick you
00:09:01.600 can just show the picture of all of us
00:09:02.760 with Elon and the incredible thing is
00:09:06.360 here you
00:09:08.200 have the most incredible entrepreneur of
00:09:11.240 our
00:09:12.000 lifetime dealing with so many
00:09:14.240 complicated issues and I'll tell you
00:09:16.079 Elon Works in one of the smallest
00:09:18.680 offices I've ever seen all he has is a
00:09:21.000 desk with an enormous screen and his
00:09:23.760 phone and you can see that there is
00:09:27.440 nothing that matters except the task
00:09:29.519 hand and that's really
00:09:31.120 inspiring like it it just puts everybody
00:09:33.839 on the same level you feel this energy
00:09:36.360 that all of these guys are doing
00:09:37.880 incredible work on behalf of the country
00:09:39.440 to a one where there's no ego about some
00:09:42.200 of these things meaning what is the
00:09:44.120 office size what is this what is that
00:09:45.680 they're just here to grind and I don't
00:09:48.519 think I've ever seen a work force more
00:09:50.240 happy like you get there and the energy
00:09:53.240 and the intensity it's very much like
00:09:55.600 the TV show westwing there's just this
00:09:57.880 constant momentum every day live a whole
00:10:00.240 lifetime and everyone is just like
00:10:03.720 energized and you like I was talking to
00:10:06.480 Sax's chief of staff and she's like
00:10:08.800 there you just never calm down like you
00:10:10.399 never you're never like there's never a
00:10:12.120 dull moment here and that's why everyone
00:10:15.079 kind of has this grin on their face
00:10:16.680 they're just so happy to be doing this
00:10:18.120 work the intensity I'm I'm going to
00:10:20.560 describe to you a 45 minute or
00:10:26.440 so experience in the oval so the next
00:10:30.920 day myself and Nat and Sak go to see pus
00:10:37.279 in the oval and there's this incredible
00:10:41.200 meeting room and you're kind of you wait
00:10:44.680 there right the waiting room it's quite
00:10:46.440 large it's very beautiful you know
00:10:47.680 beautiful sofas
00:10:49.320 Etc and
00:10:51.040 then they say oh the president's ready
00:10:53.639 to see you and you get escorted into the
00:10:56.120 oval and the one thing that strike that
00:10:58.279 struck me about the oval is it's also
00:11:00.399 much smaller than what you would think
00:11:02.040 like it's a very good size and it's a
00:11:03.639 very natural
00:11:04.959 size but it's beautiful and it's
00:11:07.639 inspiring and our experience was Nat was
00:11:10.760 in the front I'm in the middle and then
00:11:12.560 David's beside me and as we were walking
00:11:16.040 through you could hear that there was
00:11:17.560 this like very important conversation
00:11:19.079 happening
00:11:20.200 between and somebody else who I won't
00:11:22.200 say about something that I won't say but
00:11:24.680 this was really important and we walk
00:11:26.240 through the oval and we walk through the
00:11:28.120 back and we go into to his private
00:11:30.279 dining room and that has all this
00:11:33.200 incredible memorabilia sticking around
00:11:34.920 Nick maybe you can show the picture of
00:11:37.279 meat and the president so we had this
00:11:39.200 conversation and in the middle of the
00:11:41.120 conversation we had a chance to watch
00:11:43.279 some Fox News together because the
00:11:45.639 Dragon capsule was landing and I texted
00:11:48.279 Elon I said hey we're in the oval do you
00:11:50.000 want to come drop in he text back can't
00:11:52.120 Dragon capsule Landing I'm like yeah I
00:11:53.800 know we're watching it right now so Nat
00:11:56.880 myself pus
00:11:59.720 saaks we're watching this thing kind of
00:12:01.480 unfold anyways then we we have our
00:12:03.600 meeting at ends and we walk out into
00:12:07.320 sort of like this area where Taylor's
00:12:10.040 office is like where that picture was
00:12:12.639 and we continue to just randomly sit
00:12:15.000 there watching and this is what you mean
00:12:16.399 freeberg Marco Rubio comes by and so now
00:12:19.399 we're just standing around there's Marco
00:12:21.360 Rubio you were talking about the the
00:12:23.440 landing and then out of the left hand
00:12:27.279 side Shake tanon comes in because he's
00:12:30.079 there to say hi to the president then he
00:12:31.959 comes in obviously says hi to Marco
00:12:34.279 Rubio says hi to me we talk for a few
00:12:35.920 minutes he leaves so the intensity of
00:12:38.959 the people just within two steps of each
00:12:41.519 other you you saw the CIA director walk
00:12:43.720 in and
00:12:44.760 out it's just an it's an
00:12:47.519 incredibly mesmerizing place where
00:12:49.800 irrespective I think of your political
00:12:51.639 ideology the minute that you're there I
00:12:54.399 think it's hard to not be anything but
00:12:55.920 Team America I think it's impossible
00:12:58.480 actually and
00:13:00.199 it's really inspiring and by the way
00:13:03.040 coming home I feel like I'm crashing
00:13:06.120 meaning like there's such a level of
00:13:08.880 adrenaline and dopamine and you know we
00:13:10.800 are like these observers so I can only
00:13:14.079 imagine saxs what it feels like for you
00:13:15.680 when you're not in that environment it's
00:13:18.399 it's a really intoxicating mesmerizing
00:13:21.160 place I think that's well said jth and
00:13:23.279 every day there's something new you know
00:13:24.920 every day you discover something new one
00:13:27.600 day it's the the Navy where you didn't
00:13:30.160 mention that but we got a chance cut
00:13:32.360 over to that
00:13:33.600 Nick yeah we had lunch there it was
00:13:35.560 incredible did you get a photo of the
00:13:36.680 burgers I did I sent make a a photo of
00:13:39.000 the burger I got the vegg burger famous
00:13:41.440 right it's got the seal on the top yeah
00:13:43.079 it's got the seal they must use some
00:13:44.519 sort of gr tool
00:13:46.120 to burn the seal the president of the
00:13:48.880 United States onto the burgers think a
00:13:51.399 nice touch by the way you want to know
00:13:53.079 something they didn't do it on the
00:13:53.959 veggie
00:13:54.920 burger what does that sending they're
00:13:57.000 sending you a message
00:13:59.279 a message yeah by the way what's
00:14:01.199 incredible about like the the narrowness
00:14:03.320 and the smallness there's just a door
00:14:05.279 that does not look all that assuming
00:14:07.680 it's very unassuming and there's just a
00:14:09.839 small sign that says Situation
00:14:13.480 Room there's a little Corridor off of
00:14:16.839 the the westwing lobby which by the way
00:14:19.279 like you said if you're hanging out in
00:14:20.560 the westwing lobby you're going to run
00:14:21.839 into all sorts of interesting people but
00:14:23.959 you go down this little passageway it's
00:14:25.839 so small the the header of the door is
00:14:27.639 so small that SRI you know does AI
00:14:29.639 policy he's 66 he almost concussed
00:14:32.880 himself once because he hit his head at
00:14:34.600 the top of the door I think the door
00:14:36.240 frame is about 6 62 is the clearance
00:14:39.079 maybe it was made over a hundred years
00:14:41.240 ago he he literally has to duck his head
00:14:43.279 every time he walks by but any event if
00:14:45.680 you walk to the end of that passageway
00:14:47.920 there's a little kiosk to get a coffee
00:14:50.040 or you turn the other way and you're in
00:14:51.399 the situation room I mean be you could
00:14:54.240 be whacking a terrorist from 4,000 miles
00:14:57.560 away or you can get a mocha
00:15:00.040 you could do both why choose Sayan you
00:15:02.040 have a question what do you you're
00:15:03.360 taking all this in uh yeah I I want to
00:15:05.519 know from David what his favorite piece
00:15:07.600 of art is there and whether or not David
00:15:09.959 and shth saw the Declaration of
00:15:12.720 Independence yeah actually yeah well go
00:15:14.920 ahead we yeah we saw it I mean so this
00:15:18.000 is the problem say I I feel like I want
00:15:20.800 to redo that moment I mean David gets to
00:15:23.519 do it every day but I want to redo it 50
00:15:26.000 times because we didn't necessarily stop
00:15:28.199 there he has to open and close the
00:15:29.680 curtains because they want to keep the
00:15:31.040 sun off the Declaration of Independence
00:15:33.519 probably a good idea I didn't think to
00:15:35.160 like oh sir can we just stop it's just
00:15:37.440 such a whirlwind that I want to
00:15:40.759 redo I think you'll get a chance to I
00:15:43.079 think you
00:15:44.120 will well when I run and I'm president
00:15:46.560 because I'm the only one here who can I
00:15:48.519 will definitely
00:15:50.240 youan oh wait Sayan you're an American
00:15:52.440 yeah yeah you're you're way to dial up
00:15:54.800 the misogyny good good for you yeah well
00:15:56.880 no I was talking about the the besties
00:15:58.160 here I forgot for a second um she best
00:16:00.160 all right listen amazing I was wondering
00:16:01.759 about the choice of the double breasted
00:16:03.160 shamat this is a strong strong Choice
00:16:05.839 here to go double breast it to the White
00:16:07.839 House take me through the thinking so
00:16:09.800 first of all big shout out to uh Luca
00:16:12.160 rubinacci my Taylor I did double breast
00:16:14.120 it on Monday and Wednesday whoa two in
00:16:17.759 this you so you quadded it in one week
00:16:20.839 but then I I went I went single breasted
00:16:23.079 to see I did notice that yeah it's a
00:16:24.680 little gratuitous to go triple double
00:16:26.360 yeah you don't want to triple double no
00:16:27.880 by the way so we're we're hanging the
00:16:29.319 White House and we got the random it was
00:16:31.639 like 1:00 in the afternoon chth on
00:16:33.800 Monday when they said hey would you guys
00:16:36.160 like to sit down with Secretary of the
00:16:38.120 Treasury Scott bessent and so then

00:16:42.480 5:30 today and we had a dinner at 7 7:30
00:16:45.560 so it was pretty tight but we were like
00:16:47.800 yes that sounds good so then we got to
00:16:50.079 go over to treasury later in the
00:16:51.839 afternoon we had a camera guy com and
00:16:53.920 set up so yeah here's this this this
00:16:56.120 beautiful room in treasury I forgot the
00:16:57.920 name of the room
00:17:00.279 yes it was like the something chase room
00:17:02.360 I think we got to find this beautiful
00:17:04.760 room so we set up the interviews on
00:17:07.799 YouTube obviously on X and on the Main
00:17:09.640 feed it's on the Main and on the Main
00:17:10.799 feed and then we got a call after we did
00:17:15.280 the best in interview and and it you
00:17:16.880 know I think folks that were there from
00:17:18.400 press that that were that was great
00:17:21.039 Howard lutnick who chth was going to be
00:17:23.839 doing a meeting with on Wednesday
00:17:25.280 morning right before we were flying home
00:17:27.160 said what if I come in early before our
00:17:28.600 meeting jth and we do a sit down so we
00:17:31.120 said let do it so then we got to go to
00:17:33.760 the White House Press Auditorium they
00:17:36.120 have a special Auditorium just outside
00:17:38.080 the west wing and you guys will
00:17:39.640 recognize the stage obviously from many
00:17:41.720 Biden press interviews here's the the
00:17:44.320 stage and so then we did this interview
00:17:46.400 with letnik and my God this is going to
00:17:48.320 be a barn burner of an interview when it
00:17:49.840 comes out I ran into him after he had
00:17:51.520 done this interview and he was he was
00:17:53.280 excited about it sounds like you guys
00:17:55.000 were on fire he was on fire sacks I mean
00:17:57.640 this guy I think it's going there's
00:17:59.200 going to be so many Clips out of this
00:18:00.520 interview it was incredible it was like
00:18:02.080 over an hour and a half wow and he just
00:18:04.039 kept going and going he yeah after there
00:18:06.280 afterwards we went to his building by
00:18:07.559 the way you know that he's a secretary
00:18:09.039 of Commerce Howard's office is the war
00:18:10.960 department office the old war department
00:18:12.520 office so we jumped in his car and we
00:18:15.360 went to his office it is the most
00:18:17.440 beautiful I I this is again I didn't
00:18:19.960 think to stop and take photos I should
00:18:21.799 have t taken more photos but his office
00:18:24.440 is outrageously beautiful Sak I don't
00:18:27.159 know if you've been over there yeah I
00:18:28.200 have yeah I
00:18:30.200 let me let me just say one thing I want
00:18:32.880 to say that politics and policy aside
00:18:36.280 these individuals from the White House
00:18:38.679 Deputy Chief of Staff to these members
00:18:41.440 of the cabinet to all the staff that
00:18:43.280 work in the West Wing were incredibly
00:18:45.280 open and transparent there were no press
00:18:46.960 people intervening or involved it was
00:18:49.280 very random very ad hoc that we got to
00:18:51.200 have these sit down conversations and
00:18:52.600 they were just so open and I just want
00:18:54.480 to say like that was really refreshing
00:18:56.080 and really incredible and and I feel
00:18:58.000 really privileged had the opportunity to
00:18:59.679 kind of sit through this but you know I
00:19:02.120 I was not expecting this on this trip at
00:19:03.760 all I think that when you work in the
00:19:06.000 White House and and you have been
00:19:07.600 successful in the private sector like as
00:19:09.520 Scott Besson or Howard lutnick or myself
00:19:12.520 or Doug bergham or Doug beram or Elon
00:19:15.480 especially I would describe it as a
00:19:17.760 money forp purpose trade you're giving
00:19:20.159 up money but the sense of purpose you
00:19:21.960 feel working for the White House for
00:19:24.159 this President is just incredible and I
00:19:25.799 think you guys kind of picked up on that
00:19:27.720 and in my view that's a trade that you
00:19:29.520 should be happy to make any day of the
00:19:32.120 week because it is really an honor to to
00:19:34.000 work at the the White House and for this
00:19:36.360 President because he actually wants to
00:19:38.120 get things done on behalf of the
00:19:39.080 American people the default state of
00:19:41.799 Washington is just that nothing gets
00:19:43.520 done right you guys know that the
00:19:45.520 bureaucracy and the the entropy and the
00:19:48.280 inertia just basically rule the day and
00:19:50.600 so it takes a President Who number one
00:19:53.440 has a mandate for the American people
00:19:55.240 number two has a tremendous sense of
00:19:56.880 mission and purpose and number three
00:19:58.400 bring tremendous energy to the job and
00:20:00.520 then I think finally assembles the right
00:20:01.960 team around him and those are the
00:20:03.840 conditions under which you can actually
00:20:05.200 make change positive change for the
00:20:06.679 country and we have that and it's kind
00:20:08.799 of a once- in a-lifetime Opportunity if
00:20:10.919 we don't get this done now if we're not
00:20:12.640 able to cut the deficit and debt now
00:20:16.120 when are we ever going to do it this is
00:20:18.080 the you know this is a once in lifetime
00:20:20.159 opportunity and I think everybody there
00:20:21.600 feels that I think everyone in the White
00:20:24.640 House is really proud to be there and
00:20:26.080 and excited to be there and and it's fun
00:20:28.320 and you know part of it is that the you
00:20:30.360 know you can tell that the the president
00:20:32.840 he makes his job fun because he's having
00:20:35.360 a great time yeah he was really I think
00:20:37.720 Born to do this job I mean in so many
00:20:39.760 ways he just brings so much energy to it
00:20:42.400 he's IND fatigable there's so many he's
00:20:45.120 empowering he's like everyone we met
00:20:46.919 with sack to your point they've all been
00:20:48.799 successful in another part of life and
00:20:51.360 in business and whatnot and they're
00:20:52.880 generally post-economic people but he's
00:20:55.559 letting everyone run we got to meet with
00:20:57.640 several other members of the the cabinet
00:20:59.840 and they were all sharing with us that
00:21:01.520 they're being given autonomy and
00:21:03.200 Authority they can just run and I think
00:21:05.600 that that's really important if you want
00:21:06.760 to bring in high impact people you need
00:21:08.280 to let them have an impact and let them
00:21:09.799 do their thing I I observe that can I
00:21:12.120 give you one quick anecdote maybe to
00:21:13.440 wrap this segment up so when we're
00:21:15.200 sitting in when we're at the private
00:21:16.679 dining
00:21:17.480 room Steve witkoff who's another
00:21:19.960 incredible
00:21:21.080 entrepreneur was dealing with something
00:21:23.120 sensitive comes in tells the president
00:21:25.640 he's like okay great great job then
00:21:28.080 there was three other issues SX had
00:21:30.039 something then Sergio had something and
00:21:32.760 then on top of all of that so there's
00:21:34.400 this bang bang bang and then he's also
00:21:36.200 like guys listen for this dinner coming
00:21:39.080 up I really want to make sure the
00:21:40.279 Acoustics is right so everybody has an
00:21:41.760 opportunity it's like the level of
00:21:43.919 detail from the most important thing all
00:21:46.240 the way down to literally the Acoustics
00:21:48.559 in the dining room he is on top of all
00:21:50.520 of it and I was just like and that was
00:21:52.760 again just in my small little brief
00:21:54.880 observation I was like this is crazy to
00:21:57.640 your point like the energy and the the
00:22:00.039 IND fatigability and the desire to get
00:22:02.960 every little thing right it's pretty
00:22:05.080 rare it's I I kind of feel like
00:22:07.159 America's in good hands to be honest you
00:22:09.080 saw it just in those few minutes when
00:22:11.039 he's being peppered with so many
00:22:12.600 decisions so many actions so many
00:22:14.080 decisions you just realize what a
00:22:15.480 demanding job it is and you really need
00:22:18.640 a person who just is special in that way
00:22:21.720 that they're just somehow cut out for
00:22:23.480 that that type of job it is yeah very
00:22:25.880 difficult totally agree I think freeberg
00:22:27.840 is totally right if we can create a
00:22:29.440 pattern where people with high executive
00:22:32.600 let's just say that because that's less
00:22:33.960 of a loaded word than businessman or
00:22:35.840 successful
00:22:36.880 whatever people with high executive
00:22:39.080 function that have proven it should at
00:22:41.520 some point in their career step into
00:22:43.480 government and replace money for purpose
00:22:47.559 if that is a trend that this
00:22:49.039 Administration creates I think America
00:22:50.679 is incredible hands eventually which was
00:22:53.120 how the founding fathers operated the
00:22:55.440 government originally there'll be a
00:22:56.960 moment guys where the rats win right
00:23:00.039 there'll be a moment when the
00:23:01.520 Republicans return to power there'll be
00:23:03.120 a moment when all the ideologies flip
00:23:05.480 but if in all of that you can find
00:23:08.000 people who are willing to pause their
00:23:09.440 private lives have demonstrated
00:23:11.679 executive function and can make the
00:23:13.000 trade we're going to just kick ass and
00:23:15.200 give
00:23:16.240 back it's great David thank you I really
00:23:19.320 honestly thank you like you are yeah
00:23:21.919 thank you DAV awesome you're awesome
00:23:23.880 thank you for giving us window into that
00:23:26.600 and shout out to Tracy as well
00:23:31.400 she's incredible Jal what do you think
00:23:32.960 of the best in interview did you see it
00:23:35.159 I did watch the best one yeah I mean
00:23:37.840 listen I would have loved to ask him a
00:23:39.440 couple questions obviously I would have
00:23:40.919 probably done a couple of fast balls
00:23:42.200 curve balls would have gone a little bit
00:23:43.559 harder but he is so impressive and you
00:23:46.559 guys did like an hour with him and I
00:23:48.960 haven't heard what did we miss that you
00:23:50.559 would have asked yeah I mean you know
00:23:53.600 you got to get a little bit into the
00:23:55.080 chaos being it's a good time for me to
00:23:56.600 drop off yeah I'll drop off
00:24:00.600 us a better job he would do
00:24:04.039 okay we'll see you later you can tell
00:24:06.000 everyone now what a great job you would
00:24:07.520 have done love you love
00:24:11.440 you see in the
00:24:14.039 commissary what a guy no I thought it
00:24:16.200 was really good to hear from him long
00:24:18.520 form I think there's a little bit of
00:24:20.240 chaos going on with the terrorists and
00:24:21.640 stuff like that but you know I don't
00:24:22.919 think the country knows how great he is
00:24:25.399 this guy is a Powerhouse he has an
00:24:27.640 incredible track record and by the way
00:24:30.480 like Trump picking him I'm going to give
00:24:32.200 Trump a little bit of flowers here
00:24:33.440 obviously folks know I'm an independent
00:24:34.799 and an never Trumper who is you know
00:24:36.480 supporting the administration to do the
00:24:37.799 best they can what does it mean to be
00:24:39.399 independent but also have another label
00:24:41.520 that says you refuse to consider
00:24:42.960 somebody I don't understand keep options
00:24:44.360 open well no I mean I I I didn't I had
00:24:46.520 my own issues with you know what Trump
00:24:48.600 did on January 6th and we don't need to
00:24:50.200 get into it overturning roie way we
00:24:51.760 don't have to get into the things that I
00:24:52.919 don't agree with what he did putting all
00:24:55.240 those things aside I think he's done a
00:24:58.000 great job with the team he's putting
00:24:59.679 here and this is you know my message to
00:25:01.520 I think some of the Americans or the
00:25:02.720 people on the left is I would look at
00:25:04.960 what he's doing and some of these
00:25:06.399 individuals these are really high
00:25:08.240 functioning individuals the last time I
00:25:10.080 think he had a cast of characters around
00:25:11.720 him who I think were kind of dark and
00:25:14.399 and I didn't care for a lot of them with
00:25:16.279 bessent this guy is like a by I think he
00:25:19.240 you know was previously a Democrat who
00:25:20.840 gave to a ton of Democrats and he is a
00:25:23.679 Powerhouse and I think he really
00:25:25.720 understands Financial was a big donor to
00:25:28.600 Hillary and then RFK was a Democrat
00:25:31.399 tulsy was a Democrat Trump was a
00:25:33.559 Democrat I mean my point I was a
00:25:37.000 Democrat you were a Democrat yeah so I
00:25:38.919 think that's you know bessent is I came
00:25:42.279 away from it saying This Guy's super
00:25:44.679 qualified and the chaos that I think
00:25:46.799 Trump has been creating with like back
00:25:48.679 and forth with the tariffs and his
00:25:50.360 communication style it made me feel
00:25:52.679 better to know that there was somebody
00:25:54.080 who was Rock Solid like him in there and
00:25:56.880 who's really thoughtful because right
00:25:58.799 now when you talk to 50 people who are
00:26:02.080 knowledgeable about the markets and say
00:26:03.720 what is the strategy here that Trump has
00:26:06.000 you get 10 different answers five
00:26:08.320 different vectors for it people are
00:26:09.840 trying to figure out exactly what he's
00:26:11.320 trying to do and there's a lot of
00:26:14.360 nonconsensus but hearing that he's got
00:26:16.640 somebody like him there and you talking
00:26:17.960 to him for an hour I felt much better
00:26:19.520 about the situation and that maybe there
00:26:22.080 is
00:26:23.399 a I think yeah it was it was a solid
00:26:25.679 interview yeah absolutely and I mean the
00:26:27.399 access level
00:26:28.760 you know most of the time he's on
00:26:30.880 something like Meet the Press or Face
00:26:33.200 the Nation and it's 11 minutes and the
00:26:35.720 guy can't breathe totally and for him to
00:26:37.840 go an hour and you kind of you did a
00:26:40.320 good job chth of sort of giving his
00:26:41.919 history with I which I think the context
00:26:44.120 most Americans don't have so I was very
00:26:45.880 proud of the job the two of you did I
00:26:47.720 wish I was there did a great job by the
00:26:49.440 way because chth T he had a very
00:26:51.080 incredible Chim by the way I got to give
00:26:52.720 you flowers for having good intuition on
00:26:55.720 some of the questions you asked both
00:26:57.039 letnik and Bess
00:26:58.760 that I think revealed a little bit more
00:27:00.080 about their character and who they are
00:27:01.760 as people which I was not on I'm all
00:27:04.039 about like what are the hard what are
00:27:05.240 the questions I want to ask related to
00:27:06.720 policy and agenda but you did a great
00:27:09.240 job bringing that out on them and that
00:27:10.840 actually I think created a lot of
00:27:11.880 texture for both interviews that I was
00:27:13.919 not pre I was not thinking about a great
00:27:15.840 job I'm looking forward to the next one
00:27:17.240 I don't know when that drops but that
00:27:18.440 should be really good oh my god dude the
00:27:21.440 letnick interviews like I
00:27:25.000 mean he's a hardcore New Yorker and like
00:27:27.640 he really
00:27:30.279 you guys talki let me tell you yeah we
00:27:32.320 did talk about listen the thing the
00:27:34.039 thing you need to know about Howard
00:27:35.159 lutnick is he is an incredibly resilient
00:27:39.399 and resourceful businessman this guy has
00:27:42.440 built himself up literally from nothing
00:27:45.200 good human I'm a little biased but he's
00:27:48.200 a great guy and you're going to hear
00:27:50.080 some really incredible stories but again

00:29:03.159 and you know take a very public stance
00:29:06.360 and so we announced our funding
00:29:07.840 announcement on Bloomberg yesterday and
00:29:10.640 uh and our office is on 18th Street so
00:29:13.240 oh congrats yeah that's awesome what is
00:29:15.960 the mission of the Venture fund what
00:29:17.720 what what stage are you going to do you
00:29:19.080 and I started as Angel Investors
00:29:20.960 together 14 years ago yeah so we focus
00:29:23.000 on early stage seed checks first checkin
00:29:26.799 and you know this this fund um is our
00:29:29.320 fourth fund we institutionalized more in
00:29:32.440 the beginning it was high net worth
00:29:33.880 individuals and then now we're you know
00:29:36.240 going to kind of what chth was speaking
00:29:37.799 about earlier is aligning what we do
00:29:40.120 with our higher purpose and so now we're
00:29:43.360 helping you know institutions help
00:29:45.440 people go to school solving cancer and
00:29:48.000 things like that so every day that we
00:29:49.279 get up in the morning you know we're
00:29:51.039 we're aligning what we do our mission is
00:29:53.679 to chase the magically weird we're
00:29:55.399 looking for Alpha in things when every
00:29:58.120 body is consensus investing and they're
00:30:00.120 doing the same thing and talking about
00:30:01.440 the same things we're thinking six to
00:30:02.880 eight years in the future you know when
00:30:06.000 our fund three we invested in a company
00:30:08.200 in the chip space and you know we were
00:30:11.240 thinking ahead about what's going to
00:30:12.760 power Ai and crypto and now that
00:30:15.159 everybody's you know investing in the
00:30:17.120 application layer we're going into the
00:30:18.640 next thing which is like what is that
00:30:20.200 going to enable and what's coming down
00:30:23.120 the road and looking for Founders that
00:30:24.840 are thinking differently that most other
00:30:26.840 of my peers would look at and say that's
00:30:28.440 crazy I don't want to put any money into
00:30:29.799 that so that's that's what we focus on
00:30:31.720 this is such a hard thing for people to
00:30:33.960 get their heads around the non-consent
00:30:36.080 is BET and why that's so important I'm
00:30:38.240 you know I'm training you know new
00:30:39.559 Associates at our firm and they always
00:30:42.080 are going to safety so they're looking
00:30:44.519 at a vertical they're looking at a
00:30:46.240 startup and saying well this makes the
00:30:47.720 most sense and then they look at the
00:30:50.000 ones that don't make sense but that are
00:30:52.159 like intriguing and they are like yeah I
00:30:55.200 don't know if I want to place a bet on
00:30:56.600 that because I have I'm like that's
00:30:58.320 where the gold is non-consensus bet when
00:31:01.679 you and I did Uber it was a room of 21
00:31:03.919 people three people decided to invest 19
00:31:06.360 didn't yeah that was a magically weird
00:31:08.200 company at the time if you remember I
00:31:09.600 sent it around to multiple investors and
00:31:11.480 they came back with the stupidest
00:31:12.799 excuses I ever heard but it was their
00:31:14.760 excuse which is you know not everyone
00:31:17.080 wants a black car the car doesn't come
00:31:18.919 to my house yet uh no one wants to get
00:31:21.399 into a strangers vehicle the list goes
00:31:23.960 on and on but it takes a vision of
00:31:27.200 seeing the future and seeing how it
00:31:28.639 plays out and believing in all the
00:31:29.799 Miracles that are going to happen and
00:31:31.960 getting in early is where all the alpha
00:31:33.679 is you know before the thing is defined
00:31:35.799 as a category so that's where I like to
00:31:38.080 play is I don't want it to even have a
00:31:39.639 market name yet such a great observation
00:31:42.799 like when when a when an associate or
00:31:45.480 some research company says oh it's the
00:31:47.679 on demand economy that's when you know
00:31:49.840 that opportunity gone you can let that's
00:31:53.000 where like all of my peers can go lose
00:31:54.880 all their money in an ocean of dead
00:31:56.600 bodies because like
00:31:58.559 I don't want to play there yeah and you
00:32:00.760 had a price Advantage too right like if
00:32:02.519 you enter early before it's a defined
00:32:04.799 category you're taking on a lot of risk
00:32:07.000 and so you know I'm getting deals
00:32:08.399 anywhere from like five to 10 posts
00:32:10.679 while all of my peers are playing in the
00:32:12.279 20 to 30 range and so obviously it's
00:32:14.880 literally you and I are the product of
00:32:17.360 you know our early bets and like what
00:32:19.039 the lessons we learned and like one of
00:32:20.639 those lessons was to be in early um it's
00:32:23.279 literally what I'm doing founder
00:32:24.799 University now is just trying to do 100
00:32:28.000 it's just like a pre accelerator if I
00:32:30.039 find two or three founders who I like I
00:32:32.200 give them their first 25k check or 125k
00:32:35.159 check where they can just come you know
00:32:36.919 do it with me we're starting next Friday
00:32:38.480 so people want to come founder.
00:32:40.679 University but it's just like what we
00:32:42.559 used to do in the old days trying to get
00:32:43.799 in congrats be the first investor and
00:32:45.720 it's it's really working and it's super
00:32:47.679 fun Hey listen there is great news I
00:32:51.159 think for the Venture industry this
00:32:53.200 Google acquiring whiz I think this is
00:32:56.240 this could be the starters pistol
00:32:59.279 yeah it's absolutely fantastic Google
00:33:00.960 has acquired whz for
00:33:02.880 32 billion in cash if you don't know
00:33:06.480 what whiz is just imagine you have cloud
00:33:08.720 services like Microsoft's Azure Amazon
00:33:11.120 web services Google's Cloud Oracle Cloud
00:33:14.240 you need to have security between these
00:33:16.039 things they help do that it's the
00:33:18.440 largest deal in Google's history David
00:33:21.480 was there I think for some of the other
00:33:23.159 um big Acquisitions there haven't been a
00:33:26.559 lot of Acquisitions um we know the wrath
00:33:28.559 of Lena Conan was pretty acute for the
00:33:31.399 last four years but uh looking back in
00:33:34.120 history Salesforce buying slack which
00:33:37.720 our besti shth here was an early
00:33:39.159 investor in for 27 billion that occurred
00:33:41.159 in 2020 and then we had a couple of
00:33:43.240 things get blocked HP and was a juniper
00:33:45.960 I believe for 14 billion last year got
00:33:48.360 blocked and so and Adobe figma adobi
00:33:51.880 figma bled blocked in the UK blocked in
00:33:54.039 theuk blocked in the UK but they you
00:33:55.559 know assumed it was going to happen here
00:33:56.559 and this is actually we talked about
00:33:58.399 this on episode 189 shath whiz turned
00:34:01.039 down $23 billion from Google they said
00:34:03.960 at the time was because they wanted to
00:34:05.519 IPO but now reporting is saying I mean
00:34:08.359 it was because of the Anti-Trust stuff
00:34:09.918 under Biden plus the UK obviously go
00:34:12.359 ahead Jam you can take it from there I
00:34:13.719 think this is the Trump premium I mean
00:34:15.918 the problem when that deal was being
00:34:18.520 looked at back then was there was still
00:34:20.199 a chance
00:34:21.719 that there could be a Democrat
00:34:24.320 Administration and it was very clear
00:34:25.918 that they were anti
00:34:28.960 m&a and anti-tech quite honestly and
00:34:32.800 when Trump won I think it basically said
00:34:35.960 okay we can now look at these deals
00:34:37.960 there's another important part of this
00:34:40.000 though and this was part of our
00:34:41.918 interview with Howard lutnick I'd love
00:34:43.679 to just play this Quick Clip what I'm
00:34:45.560 doing is I'm saying okay I got to
00:34:46.839 collect tffs right so I go to one of the
00:34:50.159 great software companies of the earth
00:34:53.239 and I say I want you to give
00:34:55.399 me you're going to build for me for
00:34:57.720 America you're going to build the
00:34:59.200 greatest Customs processing ever but
00:35:03.000 what's incredible is you're convincing
00:35:05.079 these companies to basically like do
00:35:06.760 right for America and build a software
00:35:08.400 for you you think that's going to be a
00:35:09.440 movement throughout the government or is
00:35:10.880 that here's the idea I say build it for
00:35:13.200 me for free yeah I put it in for
00:35:16.359 free I don't know what other countries
00:35:18.680 in the world you think going to buy
00:35:20.240 now right if it works for us well
00:35:22.880 remember you have to you have to connect
00:35:24.680 to me yeah so every country
00:35:28.160 right this is aw what is he really
00:35:29.960 saying what he's really saying is there
00:35:32.680 are all kinds of companies that are
00:35:34.560 doing all kinds of work who Google
00:35:37.560 famously has this 20% time could you
00:35:39.560 imagine if some of this 20% time was
00:35:41.599 allocated to rebuilding the core
00:35:44.000 infrastructure of America and giving
00:35:46.640 back to the country that gives you the
00:35:48.359 ability to have a multi-trillion dollar
00:35:50.480 company that's but one example so when
00:35:52.920 you connect the dots the way that I
00:35:54.800 interpret it is that I think companies
00:35:56.839 will be much more aggressive on m&a
00:36:00.200 Jason it's what you've been asking for I
00:36:02.119 think you're going to get it and I think
00:36:04.000 the reason why you're going to get it is
00:36:05.240 you're going to have a very open-minded
00:36:06.880 Administration that'll let the m&a
00:36:08.440 happen but also there are ways where you
00:36:10.680 can build Goodwill by doing the kinds of
00:36:13.440 things that Howard is talking about I
00:36:14.839 mean could you imagine if somebody
00:36:16.760 volunteered let's say paler and said hey
00:36:19.640 we can build the following software for
00:36:21.720 the IRS so that we can just completely
00:36:23.560 automate tax returns and it's okay for
00:36:26.280 paler there still a 200 billion dollar
00:36:28.400 company they could allocate a small
00:36:30.119 amount of time and get that done if
00:36:31.560 Oracle stepped up and said something so
00:36:34.000 and all of that Goodwill will then allow
00:36:36.920 America to just grow faster and then
00:36:39.000 under that economic umbrella a little
00:36:42.480 consolidation is not necessarily a bad
00:36:44.599 thing so I'm really interested in how
00:36:46.839 all of these pieces move together that's
00:36:48.960 that's the one thing I get but I'd like
00:36:50.200 to say something else very narrowly
00:36:52.720 about whiz which is whis does not do
00:36:56.800 something that's necessarily unique
00:36:59.599 meaning there are other products in
00:37:01.599 Market but they have done one thing
00:37:04.640 better than everybody else and I think
00:37:06.319 it's really worth rewarding which is
00:37:08.560 they have incredible taste so if you use
00:37:12.240 it and all my
00:37:15.480 engineers at 8090 live inside of this
00:37:18.000 regime when I ask them hey we need to
00:37:20.520 implement something they all picked whiz
00:37:23.720 and if you ask them why and if you ask
00:37:25.359 our sis admin why did we implement it
00:37:27.640 not only is it good but it is the most
00:37:30.440 beautiful it is the most intuitive it's
00:37:32.640 the most well integrated and it's just
00:37:34.160 an incredible lesson where even when
00:37:36.720 other people do this other thing you can
00:37:39.920 build $ 32 billion doar of value by just
00:37:43.079 doing that thing in a more coherent way
00:37:45.680 I mean design matters right think having
00:37:48.280 taste and having taste matters having a
00:37:50.200 perspective Point great that that was
00:37:52.400 rewarded C what do you think of what
00:37:55.520 I'll call letnick Lighthouse customer
00:37:58.720 approach in other words make this piece
00:38:01.160 of software for the US government will
00:38:03.480 become your first customer the liouse
00:38:05.839 that pulls in other customers for free
00:38:08.000 and for free so we get it for free we
00:38:11.319 help you set the standard and then you
00:38:13.000 get to use us as your referen client
00:38:15.440 let's start with that thoughts on on
00:38:17.119 that and then we'll get into m&a I I
00:38:19.119 think that the government has long
00:38:21.079 relied on Private Industry to solve some
00:38:23.160 of its biggest problems and that's what
00:38:25.000 sets us apart from other countries in
00:38:26.680 the world and so you know you look at
00:38:29.720 some of the best companies like SpaceX
00:38:32.280 andal
00:38:33.680 Etc we need more companies like this if
00:38:36.319 we're going to compete and so doing this
00:38:38.880 absolutely makes sense and it's just
00:38:40.480 going to help the sales cycle to get
00:38:42.359 that sort of stamp of approval that you
00:38:44.000 know our government is using that
00:38:46.160 software freeberg your thoughts on
00:38:48.480 letnik Lighthouse strategy could it
00:38:52.599 work yeah I think this is what makes it
00:38:56.760 good to have you know as we talked about
00:38:58.800 earlier folks with high executive
00:39:00.720 function and business experience and
00:39:03.160 Acumen in key leadership positions in
00:39:05.880 the government so they know how to drive
00:39:09.280 kind of better economic outcomes
00:39:11.640 negotiating the price of a contract down
00:39:14.560 and saying in this case give it to us
00:39:16.560 for free one of the things letnick said
00:39:18.200 in the interview which you didn't see in
00:39:19.839 this clip is that the government can
00:39:22.560 actually accept four free contracts
00:39:24.960 these grus contracts and you don't need
00:39:27.440 to go get approval to do it so they can
00:39:29.599 operate in the executive branch oh that
00:39:32.000 makes total sense right you don't need
00:39:33.160 an approval if it's grus that makes
00:39:35.200 total that's right yeah that makes it
00:39:38.319 that's also a big unlock yeah well then
00:39:40.359 I guess we can contrast this chth with
00:39:42.240 Tim
00:39:43.040 Waltz you know VP potential VP candidate
00:39:47.920 I have a real problem with this clip
00:39:49.440 Jason this was the most infuriating
00:39:51.760 thing I've ever seen from a politician I
00:39:54.200 mean Tim
00:39:56.000 Waltz gets on stage pulls out his Stock
00:40:00.040 app and starts mocking the greatest
00:40:02.880 American car company ever created and
00:40:05.839 that its stock is down this is disra
00:40:09.000 ad.com to me play the clipnet I don't
00:40:12.000 some you know this on the iPhone they've
00:40:13.480 got that little Stock app I added Tesla
00:40:15.720 to it to give me a little boost during
00:40:17.240 the
00:40:18.920 day 225 and
00:40:21.800 Dro
00:40:25.040 so and
00:40:27.760 and if you own one if you own one we're
00:40:30.280 not blaming you you can you can take
00:40:32.560 dental floss and pull the Tesla thing
00:40:34.720 off you know and take shath you want to
00:40:36.960 talk about this communist scumbag and
00:40:38.839 what he did there no I'm not going to
00:40:40.400 say anything personal except to say that
00:40:42.920 I think that it is incredibly low
00:40:46.319 brow at the end of the day he represents
00:40:50.319 the American
00:40:51.880 people he needs to be firmly on Team
00:40:54.800 America I don't think he understands cuz
00:40:57.680 he's never actually had a real job but
00:41:00.119 the Auto industry is a vibrant part of
00:41:03.319 how many many many Americans earn their
00:41:06.359 living Tesla employs
00:41:09.200 125,000 plus
00:41:11.880 employees there is no reason a
00:41:14.160 politician should be wishing any
00:41:15.839 American company to fail period I just
00:41:18.000 think that should be the price of entry
00:41:20.000 and so to lack the basic decorum and
00:41:23.760 understanding and then to whip people up
00:41:25.520 into wanting any American company fail
00:41:28.319 there are many American companies sure I
00:41:30.920 like or dislike whatever it's not the
00:41:32.839 point they'll some that I'll buy the
00:41:34.359 stock of they'll some that I would not
00:41:36.680 that's not the point you cannot openly
00:41:40.000 and actively be cheering as a politician
00:41:42.960 at least for these things to fail that I
00:41:45.400 think is just incredibly low brow I I
00:41:47.760 think it's the bottoming out of the
00:41:48.920 democratic party that moment will be
00:41:50.400 looked at as the bottom Sayan any
00:41:52.400 thoughts I think it's incredibly low
00:41:53.960 brow I agree with chth and I think it's
00:41:55.760 just so distasteful for you know a
00:41:58.520 public official to do something like
00:42:00.280 that in especially for an American
00:42:02.599 company and it you know if you hear the
00:42:04.720 people cheering in the background it's
00:42:06.040 obvious that there's a base that
00:42:07.319 supports this and that frightens me even
00:42:09.160 more because he's saying these things
00:42:11.280 because his constitu his constituents
00:42:13.319 believe it and you know a politician
00:42:16.040 says these things because they think
00:42:17.880 it's going to motivate them to vote for
00:42:19.720 them in the future and that really
00:42:21.000 frightens me you know that we are riling
00:42:23.720 people up um to cheer on the ruction of
00:42:27.599 American company and possibly go out and
00:42:29.400 burn cars you know I think well that's
00:42:31.960 the that's a s yeah that because
00:42:35.520 whenever you incite like this kind of
00:42:38.280 aggressiveness and by the way both sides
00:42:39.880 do it you get a contingent who takes it
00:42:42.319 too far freeberg yeah maybe we wrap up
00:42:44.640 on this and then we can jump back to
00:42:45.839 whiz sorry for the diversion I think the
00:42:47.920 Democratic party um has split into two
00:42:51.359 parties there's the Democratic party
00:42:53.680 with beliefs and there's the Democratic
00:42:56.000 party without beliefs
00:42:57.760 I think that the Democratic party with
00:42:59.400 beliefs is the one that's very far left
00:43:02.079 and their beliefs are fundamentally
00:43:03.640 rooted in concepts of socialism Marxism
00:43:06.880 yes and they're very clear about those
00:43:08.559 beliefs that traditional power
00:43:10.400 structures need to be dismantled and
00:43:13.240 assets and influence need to be commonly
00:43:17.119 redistributed the rest of the democratic
00:43:19.520 party which people call the moderate
00:43:21.280 part of the party actually don't really
00:43:23.240 know what their beliefs are when you
00:43:25.200 talk to anyone in the Republican party
00:43:26.680 and a leader ship position you hear very
00:43:28.319 clearly what their beliefs are we saw it
00:43:30.480 this week in DC every member of the
00:43:32.480 cabinet that we met with and there were
00:43:33.839 quite a number of them had the exact
00:43:35.760 same message and the exact same set of
00:43:37.319 beliefs of what this Administration
00:43:38.880 stands for and what they're trying to do
00:43:40.640 you may agree with those beliefs or you
00:43:42.160 may not but they have stated their
00:43:43.920 beliefs the problem is that because the
00:43:46.280 moderates in the Democratic party have
00:43:47.839 not stated a set of beliefs a set of
00:43:50.599 objectives a vision for the country a
00:43:52.440 vision for their party the party is
00:43:54.839 effectively being represented by this
00:43:56.559 part of the party that does have beliefs
00:43:59.119 the deeply socialist Marxist beliefs and
00:44:01.640 they have basically subsumed the message
00:44:03.440 and as a result this is why people have
00:44:05.200 lost interest in the Democratic party
00:44:07.440 because the moderate aspect has not been
00:44:09.559 really clear on what their beliefs are
00:44:12.040 there's an opportunity for some of these
00:44:14.079 moderate leaders in the Democratic party
00:44:16.319 like Dean Phillips like and people may
00:44:19.359 not like me saying this but like Gavin
00:44:21.720 who I don't think is all the way over on
00:44:23.280 that far left side of the the Spectrum
00:44:25.520 to be really clear and paint a pet
00:44:27.440 vision and really State the beliefs of
00:44:30.119 the party and what the beliefs are that
00:44:32.079 differentiate them and those beliefs
00:44:34.359 recently the only thing that underscores
00:44:36.800 what that party stands for is we're not
00:44:39.119 the other guys we're not the Republicans
00:44:41.839 and that's it and so people that don't
00:44:43.520 like the Republicans are like well I
00:44:45.200 don't know because then I'm subsumed by
00:44:46.920 the Socialist Marxist rhetoric so I
00:44:48.720 don't know if I want to be a part of
00:44:49.720 that either and that's why I think a lot
00:44:50.800 of people feel left out and that's why I
00:44:52.280 think the recent polling data if you
00:44:53.880 pull it up on the Democrats is like 23%
00:44:57.359 or something in this country now it was
00:44:58.920 like 30s or something did you see the
00:45:01.000 crazy clip that did the racial
00:45:02.839 demographic split on some key issues
00:45:04.760 like things like Dei is this the one
00:45:06.720 that says white college age women are
00:45:09.200 just are like this weird anyway I think
00:45:11.599 Tim Waltz like a lot of others because
00:45:13.760 there's no other beliefs to stand for
00:45:15.280 you end up being subsumed by the part of
00:45:16.800 the democratic party that does have
00:45:18.079 beliefs and you don't have anything else
00:45:19.599 to say to State and to to show what
00:45:21.920 you're for I an idea too really good
00:45:25.720 it's a really good framing I really like
00:45:27.319 that well and here's another framing
00:45:28.920 like is it so hard to agree on something
00:45:32.079 like I think this is one of the
00:45:33.160 brilliant things that Trump did was he's
00:45:35.040 like here are some things we can agree
00:45:36.760 on and he just subsumed those like
00:45:38.359 fighting for the working class person
00:45:40.440 saying no tax on tips like these were
00:45:42.680 Democratic positions I think this just
00:45:44.880 proves that Meme where it's like all
00:45:47.160 standing here and and the left just went
00:45:49.400 too far left let me give you a everybody
00:45:51.680 yeah let me give you a piece of advice
00:45:54.480 to the Democratic party leadership that
00:45:56.119 might be listening the advice I would
00:45:58.160 give you is basically take away the
00:46:01.079 opportunity for the distinction that the
00:46:03.079 Republicans have right now which is a
00:46:04.559 more efficient government a more you
00:46:06.640 know Fair government where money isn't
00:46:08.040 wasted where your taxpayer dollars
00:46:09.240 aren't being destroyed the Democratic
00:46:11.359 party has an opportunity to stand up and
00:46:12.880 say we don't want to have things like
00:46:14.920 regulatory capture or this pork or
00:46:17.760 inside stuff going on they have an
00:46:19.960 opportunity to make that the core set of
00:46:21.640 beliefs that still aligns with reducing
00:46:24.559 government and increasing efficiency in
00:46:26.000 government effic efficiency in
00:46:27.400 government should not be a party issue
00:46:29.920 by allowing the Republicans to say we're
00:46:31.599 for efficient government it implies that
00:46:33.480 the Democrats now to be opposite of that
00:46:35.280 are saying we're for inefficient
00:46:36.880 government and if the Democrats want to
00:46:39.000 win this they can actually take that
00:46:40.400 message and say you know what we're for
00:46:42.200 more efficient government and the way
00:46:43.920 we're going to do it is get rid of
00:46:45.079 things like regulatory capture and
00:46:46.559 inside deals and all the other sort of
00:46:48.520 stuff it may you know that may not kind
00:46:50.920 of go but there's an opportunity for the
00:46:52.440 Democrats I think to really stand up and
00:46:55.480 take the country in the direction that
00:46:56.960 we all As Americans need it to go to
00:46:59.160 which is to have a sustainable federal
00:47:00.760 government and that's going to require
00:47:02.559 some degree of fiscal conservatism and
00:47:04.319 action but they could take a different
00:47:05.760 point of view on how they do it and they
00:47:06.920 could have core beliefs around that it's
00:47:08.839 it's really and and by the way Dean
00:47:10.359 Phillips were inviting back on the
00:47:11.800 program Ezra Klein Sam Harris we want to
00:47:14.040 have some more people on the left come
00:47:15.280 on here and maybe talk about this very
00:47:16.760 issue it's really three things they
00:47:18.200 could work on number one build 10
00:47:20.599 million homes in this country that are
00:47:22.720 affordable that's a really key issue
00:47:25.559 rich people should pay their Fair share
00:47:27.200 share of taxes and reform the tax code
00:47:29.920 and then uh third health care for
00:47:31.720 everyone those three would get this
00:47:34.000 party back on track we're going to make
00:47:35.839 a more efficient government you're going
00:47:37.160 to be able to buy a home you're going to
00:47:38.720 get health care and rich people are
00:47:40.280 going to start paying their taxes which
00:47:41.559 they're not and we're going to stop with
00:47:42.680 these crazy Trump tax breaks that would
00:47:44.480 be the perfect positioning and it's not
00:47:46.359 personal it's just hey we're a rich
00:47:48.319 enough country that people should get
00:47:50.480 health care why shouldn't people have
00:47:51.800 Healthcare in the modern world why can't
00:47:53.480 these rich people who are donating tens
00:47:55.200 of millions of dollars to Trump just
00:47:56.839 just pay some more taxes and and make
00:47:58.280 sure poor people have basic healthare
00:48:00.440 Sayan your thoughts and then let's get
00:48:02.040 back to the docket well I disagree with
00:48:04.040 all those points obviously but sure they
00:48:06.760 could run on them uh they have tried
00:48:09.000 they've they've definitely said we're
00:48:10.359 going to have you know health care for
00:48:11.760 all you know selling the American dream
00:48:13.960 of home ownership I actually think is
00:48:15.720 flawed in many ways we're putting people
00:48:18.800 into debt and for things they can't
00:48:21.200 afford and they get screwed and so I I
00:48:24.640 just actually think uh they to find a
00:48:27.559 unifying figure out who their moderates
00:48:29.760 are and there's also politically
00:48:31.079 homeless people we didn't include them
00:48:33.200 you know there's these people who are
00:48:34.359 just like well I can't vote right and
00:48:36.319 I'm not left either anymore so we've got
00:48:39.440 to bridge this divide somehow and
00:48:41.839 they've got to figure out the messaging
00:48:43.200 but I don't think going back to what
00:48:44.839 they used to do is going to work because
00:48:46.720 they promised universal healthcare and
00:48:48.920 it hasn't happened and they had plenty
00:48:50.319 of opportunity to do
00:48:52.119 so all right let's get back to the whiz
00:48:54.319 deal and the uh and the docket here
00:48:56.880 let's see if we there's anything we
00:48:57.920 didn't uh well we should talk about the
00:49:01.000 um you know the price they paid and we
00:49:03.160 should talk about how to do that the
00:49:04.960 Strategic rationale and how others are
00:49:07.319 going to respond all right so looking at
00:49:09.839 this the DL got sweetened massively over
00:49:12.200 the year between when the first offer
00:49:14.799 was made for 23 billion and then went up
00:49:17.000 to 32 billion the revenue roughly
00:49:19.599 doubled since the time of the first
00:49:22.040 offer and then there's some really
00:49:24.440 interesting things in the details there
00:49:25.880 is a huge breakup fee we saw the breakup
00:49:28.319 fee with Adobe and figma this one is
00:49:30.960 tremendous it's 10% of the deal size
00:49:33.400 $3.2 billion in cash they don't get an
00:49:35.960 investment if this deal doesn't go
00:49:37.440 through Google has to give whiz $3.2
00:49:40.240 billion in cash let that snc in this
00:49:42.559 company is massively high growth Zer to
00:49:46.319 100 million in their in 18 months uh
00:49:48.400 when they started and last year they
00:49:51.000 passed 500 million in ARR you know that
00:49:53.640 puts the deal at roughly 60 times
00:49:56.359 they're
00:49:58.079 run rate and that is a high price
00:50:00.559 however they're supposed to hit a
00:50:02.240 billion in ARR this year which would put
00:50:04.640 it at 30 times forward looking or 32
00:50:08.040 times which isn't outrageous because
00:50:09.760 Google probably has freeberg some
00:50:12.160 concept or alphabet rather some concept
00:50:14.720 of how they could increase the velocity
00:50:16.760 of
00:50:17.880 that of that Revenue yeah or that it
00:50:20.480 would be a defensive position one of
00:50:21.960 those two
00:50:23.280 yeah yeah I mean just to put it in
00:50:26.000 context right Google's Cloud revenue is
00:50:28.799 about 40 billion a year and Microsoft
00:50:32.599 and Amazon are both kind of plus or
00:50:34.640 minus a little bit around 100 billion a
00:50:36.720 year and so Google has kind of been as
00:50:39.720 we know lagging a little bit in the
00:50:41.880 cloud
00:50:43.160 Market the the thing about kind of
00:50:45.760 Enterprise
00:50:47.200 sales is there's a common strategy which
00:50:50.359 is you kind of land with a beach head
00:50:52.319 and then you kind of expand from there
00:50:54.040 with additional products and services
00:50:56.319 this is has been the reason so many
00:50:58.920 enterprise software companies over time
00:51:00.960 from Oracle to
00:51:02.559 Salesforce to Microsoft have been
00:51:05.280 acquisitive and can make Acquisitions
00:51:07.760 very synergistic what that means is you
00:51:10.799 can acquire a new product or a new
00:51:12.359 service and then sell it into your
00:51:14.400 install base or acquire the customers
00:51:18.079 and then cross- sell your existing
00:51:19.960 products or Services into their install
00:51:21.720 base and so you can increase the overall
00:51:24.000 Revenue by putting the two together and
00:51:25.400 combining sales teams and being able to
00:51:27.319 offer a combined offering and so the
00:51:29.760 theory here and I think this is
00:51:31.280 something I don't understand well enough
00:51:33.160 is that
00:51:34.240 security has become such a kind of top
00:51:38.200 requirement and and product category
00:51:40.839 that it now effectively enables a beach
00:51:44.079 head type model to be successful meaning
00:51:46.400 you can cross sell the security into all
00:51:48.000 of your existing customers or there's
00:51:50.000 enough new customers that Google might
00:51:51.599 be acquiring from The Whiz acquisition
00:51:53.799 that they can now bring new gcp services
00:51:56.240 to
00:51:57.119 and and cross sell into now to figure
00:51:59.760 out how this actually has to make sense
00:52:01.240 so Google's roic is about
00:52:04.480 30% that means that when they make an
00:52:06.839 investment a capex investment or capital
00:52:08.839 investment they expect to see about 30%
00:52:11.799 of incremental profit per year come back
00:52:15.160 at some point from that capital
00:52:17.079 investment the capital investment
00:52:18.319 they're making here again this doesn't
00:52:19.599 hit their income statement goes on their
00:52:21.319 balance sheet it gets marked mostly As
00:52:23.599 Goodwill so Google's going to have a 32
00:52:26.520 ion move from cash down to Goodwill so
00:52:28.880 now they've got this asset on their
00:52:30.040 balance sheet and they've got to make an
00:52:31.640 incremental $10 billion a year profit so
00:52:34.240 you kind of got to do the math $10
00:52:35.440 billion a year of incremental profit
00:52:37.520 against 40 billion of cloud revenue and
00:52:41.359 against 1 billion of whiz Revenue
00:52:44.319 there's a lot to be kind of built here
00:52:46.559 to make this make Financial sense so
00:52:49.520 then it becomes okay well that's a
00:52:50.920 really hard one to kind of think that
00:52:52.400 they're going to get there very soon but
00:52:54.000 remember Google's made some Investments
00:52:56.559 I think it's a very tricky you said it
00:52:59.240 earlier actually it's a trojan horse
00:53:01.000 into the other
00:53:02.440 clouds there you know the reason wiiz
00:53:04.599 exists and Jason mentioned this up front
00:53:06.240 is because of the value that it creates
00:53:07.920 in a multicloud multi-tenant environment
00:53:09.799 across aure in gcp and and AWS and when
00:53:13.280 the deal was done one of the things that
00:53:14.880 whiz said is hey don't worry we're not
00:53:16.480 going to prefer
00:53:18.559 gcp and it was interesting because I
00:53:21.200 thought wait people actually thought
00:53:22.799 that they would just prefer gcp no it's
00:53:25.160 the exact opposite of why Google would
00:53:27.640 want this because now what you have are
00:53:29.799 your tentacles like think of any other
00:53:32.920 service that any cloud provider provides
00:53:36.240 where most of your revenue is coming
00:53:37.880 from the other clouds can you name one
00:53:40.720 well it didn't exist until now and so I
00:53:43.559 think the Strategic rationale is quite
00:53:45.920 clever which is you start to gain
00:53:47.640 customer traction and workloads in all
00:53:49.920 of these other environments and I
00:53:51.400 suspect that TK is smart enough to try
00:53:53.680 to pull these workloads back into gcp
00:53:57.640 so that that's like I think probably
00:53:59.680 like because they were you're saying jat
00:54:01.200 they would have the data they would be
00:54:02.799 able to see from whiz like hey look of
00:54:05.559 90% of this this type of job is existing
00:54:08.200 on Oracle or it's over here on AWS or
00:54:10.799 all three of you would do that if you're
00:54:11.880 running Google CL Thomas C is smart
00:54:14.119 enough and they're not gonna pay and
00:54:16.000 David by the way the other thing that I
00:54:17.559 would say is I think this is where
00:54:19.480 bankers get this totally wrong as the
00:54:21.640 Observer watching a deal like this is
00:54:24.640 it's never about the rate of change when
00:54:26.720 you're trying to do a deal it's always
00:54:28.559 about the rate of change of the rate of
00:54:30.480 change and the most incredible thing
00:54:32.680 that whiz had going for itself was that
00:54:34.359 they were basically doubling in months
00:54:37.799 so the time to double at that scale you
00:54:40.839 can do any kind of Fantastical model
00:54:43.040 with that kind of raw input because when
00:54:45.200 that boundary condition is true and
00:54:47.040 you're trying to you know deescalate or
00:54:49.119 scale down or we down a model you're
00:54:51.799 still going to get crazy gargantuan
00:54:53.760 numbers that when you discount them back
00:54:56.040 gets to this price so I mean congrats to
00:54:58.160 these guys I don't you know I would love
00:55:00.200 to find out how does whiz because this
00:55:03.040 is I mean I'm sure you guys have this
00:55:04.160 question to how do you build a sales
00:55:07.280 infrastructure that can scale that
00:55:09.280 productively that quickly that's an
00:55:11.079 incredible thing you know yeah I wonder
00:55:13.480 if a lot of people are I wonder if it's
00:55:15.440 a lot of self- sered to sign up and use
00:55:17.559 it it's got to be yeah some percentage
00:55:19.599 of it I mean I'll tell you our
00:55:21.000 experiences we had a guy that had to
00:55:22.400 come in and sell it into us and we had a
00:55:23.839 little bit of a bake off and I don't
00:55:25.280 know maybe we were unique and there's a
00:55:26.799 simpler lower scale product that's just
00:55:29.039 more pgo consumption yeah yeah who knows
00:55:33.839 say looking at this I'm curious your
00:55:36.319 take on big VC because the uh series a$
00:55:40.440 hundred million round we don't have the
00:55:41.960 valuation for it the B was at 1.7
00:55:44.160 billion a year later so maybe we assume
00:55:45.960 it was a $500 million valuation for 20%
00:55:48.640 something like that I would guess maybe
00:55:50.400 a 600 million post Sequoia Insight index
00:55:53.520 cyber starts all did that series a when
00:55:55.839 you look the BC d and e those same
00:55:58.839 players all participated this is another
00:56:01.400 example of sometimes your best next
00:56:04.160 investment as a VC firm is the highest
00:56:07.160 growth outlier in your existing
00:56:09.200 portfolio your thoughts on what this
00:56:10.599 means in terms of venture capital and
00:56:12.680 maybe the Log Jam that we saw over the
00:56:14.920 last four years five years of no m&a and
00:56:19.319 because we you and I came up when like
00:56:22.160 it was a golden era of m&a and then you
00:56:24.839 know the IPO Market started open up with
00:56:26.839 Airbnb coinbase and of course Uber now
00:56:29.599 we're sitting here what could if this is
00:56:32.160 the starters pistol what could it look
00:56:33.920 like for the VC industry which has just
00:56:36.559 been dead yeah I'm start with you know
00:56:39.799 my thoughts on Whiz I think this is
00:56:41.920 really exciting for me because this is a
00:56:44.000 great example of a contrarian investment
00:56:46.920 when this investment was initially made
00:56:49.039 there was not a lot of money going into
00:56:51.039 security there still isn't it's an
00:56:52.440 underinvested category and with AI and
00:56:55.520 the threat of the types of things that
00:56:57.319 can people can build and Vibe coding and
00:56:59.559 everything in between you're going to
00:57:01.359 need better security and so I'm excited
00:57:04.400 to see that maybe this might become an
00:57:06.480 investable category I think this is the
00:57:08.000 largest exit ever in the security space
00:57:11.119 am I am I wrong I mean I think I I think
00:57:14.000 you're probably correct got to be I
00:57:16.119 don't think I've ever heard of anything
00:57:17.440 this large m&a wise absolutely yeah so
00:57:20.440 you know how does this impact m&a I mean
00:57:22.720 it's still pretty slow out there you
00:57:24.440 know some actions better than no action
00:57:26.240 but like Niantic was just bought by
00:57:28.359 scopely we're starting to see you were
00:57:30.440 an angel investor in that right that was
00:57:32.119 the Pokémon go folks I remember you
00:57:33.760 showing me Pokemon go over a decade ago
00:57:36.280 yeah that's amazing that's a Saudi
00:57:38.520 company that bought it look like a Saudi
00:57:40.200 conglomerate that's a Saudi conglomerate
00:57:42.680 and so that exited for 3.7 billion and
00:57:45.839 you know I I think we're going to start
00:57:47.119 seeing some movement especially with the
00:57:49.200 new Administration when we how long were
00:57:51.319 you in that uh deal how many years were
00:57:54.039 you in that deal oh my gosh as soon as
00:57:55.760 they spun out an alphabet uh formed and
00:57:58.200 spun them out as their own entity I
00:58:00.599 there's a funny story for another time
00:58:02.039 about how I got into the deal uh but I I
00:58:05.240 realized it was my only opportunity to
00:58:07.079 get in as early as possible and so I
00:58:09.400 stalked the founder and sat at his door
00:58:11.160 and oh tell us the story okay all right
00:58:13.160 well permission permission granted you
00:58:14.680 can't say it's a great story a great
00:58:16.760 story so before Pokemon go they had this
00:58:18.880 game called Ingress and I started
00:58:21.160 playing it with my friends and I started
00:58:22.680 noticing that my friends were doing some
00:58:25.119 really unusual things they were like
00:58:27.079 charting helicopters and like traveling
00:58:29.880 all over the world to cast these
00:58:31.319 invisible triangles over the Earth
00:58:33.559 basically it's a game of green versus
00:58:35.359 blue and who can cast the biggest
00:58:37.119 triangle I was like why are these people
00:58:39.119 spending so much time and not only that
00:58:41.160 but why are they going around taking
00:58:42.480 pictures of points of interest for
00:58:44.480 Google like what is Google actually
00:58:46.440 doing with this asset was my number one
00:58:48.680 question so I realized that Ingress was
00:58:51.880 part of a bigger mapping plan mean if
00:58:54.920 you look at the team you look at hanky
00:58:56.599 they all come from Keyhole and they're
00:58:58.599 obviously part of the maps team and help
00:59:00.079 build Google Earth so this wasn't just a
00:59:02.000 game Pokémon go was a joke it was
00:59:04.480 basically an April Fool's joke where the
00:59:07.039 founder of Pokemon said wouldn't it be
00:59:09.200 cool if like we put Pokemon on the map
00:59:11.680 and we just tried to find them and John
00:59:13.839 Hank's like uh yeah like let's turn this
00:59:16.599 into an engress likee game I went around
00:59:20.079 telling everybody like if I had a chance
00:59:21.680 to invest in anything it would be
00:59:23.440 Niantic and because they were part of
00:59:25.440 Google I thought there was no chance and
00:59:27.599 then I got a call one day and they said
00:59:29.839 hey my friend of mine was like did you
00:59:31.119 hear Niantic spun out I was like oh my
00:59:33.319 gosh I don't know anyone at Google how
00:59:34.760 do I reach John hanky and I realized I'd
00:59:37.880 invested in this company called hint
00:59:39.319 waterer and they were giving out game
00:59:41.000 codes on the bottle cap and uh I was
00:59:43.920 setting up her ticketing system one day
00:59:45.520 and helping her out in her office and I
00:59:46.880 saw all these tickets coming in with the
00:59:48.960 subject line that said engrish game code
00:59:50.559 and I was like what is this all about
00:59:52.039 and I just connected the dots and she
00:59:53.440 introduced me to John hanky and then I
00:59:55.599 went there with two Engineers cuz I
00:59:57.000 figured I got to show up with some value
00:59:58.559 here um two badass Engineers who are
01:00:01.559 players we sat on the front stairs and
01:00:04.319 basically sat there and said please take
01:00:06.200 our money he's like I don't need you
01:00:07.440 I've got Nintendo I've got Google I've
01:00:09.520 got and we're like no you really need us
01:00:12.520 uh and he gave one of those Engineers a
01:00:14.400 job offer pretty much that day he gave
01:00:17.079 me a key card to the office and so I can
01:00:19.280 come and go from Niantic as I please
01:00:20.760 which is pretty awesome aming conations
01:00:23.160 fun story you know yeah yeah no I mean
01:00:25.400 this is what ites to get in deals in
01:00:26.799 Silicon Valley all right the FED held
01:00:29.720 rate steady on Wednesday markets have
01:00:31.640 been digesting this uh pretty flat the
01:00:34.440 second consecutive meeting of course
01:00:36.839 where the FED held rates steady this is
01:00:40.440 after the two consecutive Cuts in
01:00:42.559 September 50 basis points uh in
01:00:45.319 September and then obviously 25 in
01:00:47.200 December and we had this high hopes that
01:00:49.640 there would be you know four or five of
01:00:51.280 these Cuts this year and there are
01:00:52.880 apparently none right now Trump posted
01:00:56.119 truth social that he urged the FED to
01:00:58.119 cut rates to create a smoother
01:00:59.400 transition for his tariffs the tariffs
01:01:01.559 are taking place I believe on April 2nd
01:01:03.359 is that date that's going to change the
01:01:05.079 history of the United States
01:01:07.520 forever and so uh there were some other
01:01:10.520 interesting takeaways they Lowered
01:01:12.799 Expectations on Ray Cuts uh they expect
01:01:14.799 two quarter point cuts for the rest of
01:01:16.440 2025 this would take us down to about 4%
01:01:19.599 your thoughts chath let's add some color
01:01:23.280 from Scott Besson one of the biggest
01:01:25.200 mistakes that I think Janet Yellen
01:01:27.799 affected was this continued issuance of
01:01:32.680 money on the short end of the curve to
01:01:34.599 finance these deficits which gives you
01:01:38.400 you inherit an incredibly difficult
01:01:40.359 challenge I think over the next nine
01:01:42.119 months I think there's like nine or 10
01:01:43.839 trillion that has to get refinanced do
01:01:45.440 you want to talk about that and yeah
01:01:47.720 look I I I thought that it that when
01:01:50.559 rates were low you're supposed to turn
01:01:52.640 out rates exactly and in instead
01:01:56.440 the the treasury for the past few years
01:01:59.760 has pulled rates in and I think part of
01:02:02.240 that was to keep rates
01:02:05.079 lower that they they change the issuance
01:02:07.960 schedule when rates move back up towards
01:02:11.200 5% I I um have maintained that policy
01:02:17.240 but I'm maintaining it because it's
01:02:19.640 going back to David's
01:02:22.079 question of when when are you going when
01:02:25.240 are we going to see the results from
01:02:27.839 this the getting the government spending
01:02:30.119 under control and I don't think the
01:02:32.039 markets recognize it yet okay translate
01:02:34.599 for Jamal yeah so he's saying a couple
01:02:37.720 things he he he has inherited a problem
01:02:40.240 that he hasn't quite yet changed what is
01:02:43.200 that problem that problem is that when
01:02:46.079 rates are low you want to borrow for as
01:02:48.279 long as possible right you don't want to
01:02:50.160 borrow for the shortest amount of time
01:02:52.920 and now that rates are high you're in
01:02:55.119 this difficult POS position where you
01:02:56.720 have to refinance all of it at a much
01:02:58.359 higher rate that's effectively the net
01:03:00.480 of
01:03:01.279 it what I took away and you can see more
01:03:04.319 and understand more when you watch his
01:03:05.920 old interview with freeberg and I but I
01:03:08.920 think that there's been a fundamental
01:03:10.640 disconnect and break from the fed and
01:03:14.440 the rest of Treasury and the government
01:03:18.119 and I think that Scott was very clear
01:03:20.440 like he views that as an independent
01:03:22.000 organization and it should continue that
01:03:24.000 way but it was very clear to me that
01:03:26.240 they are singing from their own hm book
01:03:28.680 and it just doesn't seem to me that
01:03:31.240 Powell really understands the gravity of
01:03:33.119 this situation and I don't think that
01:03:34.960 he's really willing to play ball so he's
01:03:38.760 probably on the margins again this is my
01:03:41.200 total interpretation of
01:03:43.039 this would rather wait longer than
01:03:46.319 necessary because I think it's it's
01:03:48.400 almost like a political Gambit and I
01:03:51.200 think that that's very dangerous that's
01:03:52.799 again just my own interpretation I just
01:03:55.039 do not think that Powell
01:03:57.279 a has the data to make a very clear
01:04:00.319 decision and B will act unless it's
01:04:04.599 totally necessary so I think this
01:04:06.520 there's an overcorrection here that's
01:04:08.440 happening which I think is dangerous and
01:04:10.440 I think it's going to slow down the pace
01:04:12.640 of cuts which I think will then create a
01:04:16.920 lot of other pressure in the economy
01:04:20.200 well Dave uh I'll jump it drop it to you
01:04:22.119 the fed's Mandate as an independent
01:04:24.000 organization is full employment and and
01:04:26.640 that 2% Target which we talked about
01:04:28.640 before here was just a number that was
01:04:30.680 picked by an economist in New Zealand of
01:04:33.279 all places it's it's not like it's some
01:04:35.599 specific dosage that is perfect but it
01:04:38.599 is their mandate they're not supposed to
01:04:40.760 be a political organization so what are
01:04:42.480 your thoughts on this situation and
01:04:44.839 these high rates which we have to pay
01:04:48.640 for our
01:04:50.960 debt we've never been in a situation
01:04:55.920 where in a 100 days a federal government
01:04:59.440 is setting out to cut their spending by
01:05:01.680 a trillion dollars which has a
01:05:05.000 significant effect a recessionary effect
01:05:07.160 on the economy because there's less
01:05:09.319 federal dollars flowing out which goes
01:05:11.319 as Revenue into various businesses and
01:05:14.440 income for a lot of people that are
01:05:15.680 employed as contractors or directly by
01:05:17.839 federal government
01:05:19.799 agencies coupled with for the first time
01:05:23.000 in 100 years a significant change in the
01:05:26.480 policy for
01:05:27.839 tariffs for goods flowing into the
01:05:30.079 United States and whether that will
01:05:32.680 reduce spending by consumers or drive up
01:05:35.640 the cost of products by consumers and we
01:05:37.760 talked extensively about both of these
01:05:39.559 issues with bessent and letnik in DC
01:05:42.319 this week and if I'm the FED I don't
01:05:46.079 really have a great proxy historically
01:05:49.400 for saying when this was done in the
01:05:51.160 past here's what the effect would be on
01:05:54.119 GDP here's what the effect would be on
01:05:56.760 inflation here's what the effect is
01:05:58.119 going to be on uh employment in fact
01:06:02.480 folks like lutnick are making the case
01:06:06.000 that the current measure of GDP is
01:06:08.599 probably not even correct the way we
01:06:10.599 measure it the way we count it and so
01:06:13.359 the traditional economist's point of
01:06:15.440 view on making rate adjustments as a
01:06:18.079 function
01:06:19.480 of economic contraction or growth may be
01:06:23.119 wrong so I think there are quite a lot
01:06:25.680 of these kind of confounding factors
01:06:27.359 that the FED is in a very wait and see
01:06:29.359 mode what I would look to is the bond
01:06:32.079 market which also seems to be in a kind
01:06:34.920 of wait and see mode so remember right
01:06:37.440 before the election the bond market
01:06:40.119 traded the tenure up so that rates went
01:06:42.279 down to about
01:06:44.319 3.65% about a month ago the tenure was
01:06:47.079 at 4.5% and today it's at
01:06:49.599 4.22% and so in the last month we've
01:06:52.359 seen rate on the 10year decline by about
01:06:55.880 a quarter point or about 30 basis points
01:06:59.480 and so the bond market is giving some
01:07:01.359 kind of opening to the FED saying look
01:07:04.200 we expect that this is going to be
01:07:06.559 deflationary this is going to be
01:07:09.039 recessionary we are expecting you to cut
01:07:11.680 rates to the fed and so that's what the
01:07:14.599 bond market is saying and now I think
01:07:17.039 we're going to start to wait for the
01:07:18.359 reports that are going to start to come
01:07:20.000 out that are going to show the impact I
01:07:22.920 don't think we're going to know
01:07:24.240 immediately so I think the first 100
01:07:26.599 days of this presidency and this
01:07:28.079 administration's
01:07:29.520 actions are going to be pretty telling
01:07:31.760 on what's going to happen going forward
01:07:33.480 in terms of the effect on employment on
01:07:36.440 inflation and on GDP contraction or
01:07:39.720 growth and then I think the market will
01:07:42.079 know how to handicap those numbers in
01:07:45.319 the future based on actions by the
01:07:47.279 administration right now we're still in
01:07:49.119 a like I don't know how when you put all
01:07:50.960 these things together what it does and
01:07:52.680 it's a lot happening real fast and so
01:07:54.640 wait and see
01:07:57.119 yeah Sayan I'm not sure if the fed and
01:08:01.000 you know the people in the
01:08:01.799 administration can't communicate the
01:08:03.200 strategy perfectly well and the FED
01:08:05.799 can't interpret it I don't know that
01:08:07.160 we're going to solve it here but any any
01:08:09.079 thoughts on this well I don't know if
01:08:10.480 they're not communicating it well
01:08:11.599 bessent did that it's the effect that it
01:08:13.400 will have ultimately on the economy and
01:08:14.920 over what time scale that's what's
01:08:16.238 uncertain right now sorry specifically
01:08:18.479 the tariffs I mean you know if they're
01:08:20.679 on they're off to what extent you know I
01:08:23.759 don't it doesn't feel like the ire
01:08:25.759 Administration is on the same page
01:08:27.158 that's just you know based on everybody
01:08:29.238 I've talked the FED is not part of the
01:08:30.880 administration of course not yes they're
01:08:32.560 independent quote today in the Wall
01:08:34.399 Street Journal Nick you can look for it
01:08:35.960 is Powell's statement basically blamed
01:08:38.198 Rising inflation in this short-term
01:08:40.120 period on exogenous factors he said our
01:08:42.600 job was getting the job done and now
01:08:44.679 there's exogenous inflation and I think
01:08:46.479 what he's pointing to are these
01:08:48.040 potential tariffs or something so I
01:08:49.640 think it's it's less that they're not
01:08:51.000 coordinated I think that they are on
01:08:53.479 very different pages and I don't think
01:08:55.040 the Fed wants to play ball sorry s and
01:08:56.920 then I have the story at the end just
01:08:58.279 quickly you know one of the things that
01:08:59.679 really concerns me is how we've been so
01:09:01.839 high on cheap supply for so long like if
01:09:04.279 you look at Shen and teimo before this
01:09:06.799 uh podcast I wouldn't looked up that
01:09:08.359 their prices are up by 27% or something
01:09:10.799 like that and so when you used to be
01:09:12.359 able to get a garment for $18 you're now
01:09:14.520 paying $37 and Zara is like 75 for an
01:09:17.759 equivalent and I think people really
01:09:20.120 liked getting packages in the mail and
01:09:21.679 feeling like their dollar went further
01:09:23.640 and it's not going far and so when you
01:09:25.839 have a bunch of people who can't buy
01:09:27.679 anything and consumerism is a big part
01:09:29.960 of our unfortunately in some ways our
01:09:31.920 culture you know what does that do to
01:09:36.279 our country you know if if you're
01:09:38.319 looking around there's Urban blight
01:09:39.839 everywhere in retail and you know we
01:09:42.880 can't fill our malls we don't have brick
01:09:44.560 and mortar stores they're shutting down
01:09:46.120 Forever 21 just shut down you know the
01:09:48.880 these are the types of things that you
01:09:50.679 know people really care about is whether
01:09:52.799 especially in a time where you know you
01:09:55.440 do have a recession uh people want to
01:09:57.880 buy a tube of lipstick or or a dress to
01:10:00.440 feel better about their life and right
01:10:03.080 now they can't even do that and so
01:10:05.159 that's that's what concerns me is
01:10:06.719 thinking about the retail future and
01:10:08.480 then you know the consumer landscape of
01:10:10.480 how this all affects
01:10:12.000 everybody yeah and consumer confidence
01:10:14.120 is not good right now people are feeling
01:10:15.719 like a little bit concerned about it and
01:10:18.480 this immigration plays into this we're
01:10:20.679 supposed to be deporting 20 million
01:10:22.239 people maybe it's only going to be a
01:10:23.679 million who knows about that ISS issue
01:10:25.600 who's going to actually work in these
01:10:27.000 factories are people getting laid off or
01:10:29.600 are they not getting laid off like
01:10:30.840 there's just a soup of issues here that
01:10:32.840 makes the fed's job extremely difficult
01:10:35.320 so in an extremely difficult confusing
01:10:37.719 storm what is the best thing to do when
01:10:39.560 you're driving the storm is just maybe
01:10:41.440 try to keep the car going straight not
01:10:43.120 hit the brakes or not hit the gas and
01:10:45.199 that's what they're doing they're taking
01:10:46.199 a wait and see and let's see if the
01:10:48.040 administration can be a little bit
01:10:49.640 crisper I think in their delivery of
01:10:52.080 what their plan is because it does seem
01:10:53.920 chaotic to me
01:10:55.760 and people here might disagree Jam you
01:10:57.560 said you had an anecdote well I I kind
01:11:00.120 of disagree with you in one way I I just
01:11:02.120 think the FED has totally lost a script
01:11:03.719 and I don't think they're I don't think
01:11:05.600 they're doing what they're supposed to
01:11:06.800 be doing what should they be doing what
01:11:09.560 they should be doing is actually
01:11:10.800 observing the fact that there's some
01:11:12.520 very complicated money flows the front
01:11:14.840 end of the curve makes no sense the back
01:11:16.480 end of the curve hasn't gone down long
01:11:18.080 enough they sat around and they allowed
01:11:20.480 treasury to basically pump trillions of
01:11:23.040 short-term paper so they were complicit
01:11:26.760 in what Yellen did and it it's
01:11:29.120 inconceivable that they didn't
01:11:30.679 understand that strategy and so it's
01:11:32.320 inconceivable so what's the future yeah
01:11:34.719 so what do you do when you have a is
01:11:37.239 recalcitrant the right word you know
01:11:38.960 like let's let's just say you just have
01:11:40.360 an organization that refuses to play
01:11:42.000 ball again there was a really
01:11:44.560 interesting anecdote where bessent
01:11:46.320 talked this is in the interview about
01:11:49.120 how he really wants to deregulate and
01:11:52.199 loosen up Bank lending standards
01:11:54.920 particular particularly at the community
01:11:56.760 level and I think that this is one very
01:11:59.840 interesting thing that is a workaround
01:12:01.520 to the FED why because if you think
01:12:04.600 about where money gets transacted on a
01:12:07.080 10 to 20 to 30e duration those are the
01:12:10.080 big boys they're making big Capital
01:12:11.840 plays right guys but where is like the
01:12:14.840 where's where do you play for the two
01:12:17.360 Monon to twoyear kind of thing it's
01:12:19.719 smaller stuff it's the stuff that's
01:12:21.239 required to get small businesses off the
01:12:22.800 ground it's the community lending
01:12:24.400 standards that actually allow
01:12:26.480 communities to thrive and so I think
01:12:28.800 Scott realizes that if the fed's not
01:12:31.520 going to really play ball how do you
01:12:33.440 loosen credit how do you make sure that
01:12:35.840 that money is available Jason to make
01:12:37.400 sure that you can fight off a recession
01:12:39.199 you have to give it to these smaller
01:12:41.639 Banks and he was pretty clear about that
01:12:43.880 so I think that that's it's it's almost
01:12:45.719 as if the FED is just going to get
01:12:47.120 relegated to this like random
01:12:49.520 organization like yeah they'll control
01:12:51.239 reverse repo but they just won't have
01:12:52.920 any credibility and maybe that's not a
01:12:55.960 bad thing actually in the end freeberg
01:12:57.719 it's your chance to shine we have not
01:13:00.000 one but we have two amazing space
01:13:04.040 stories in science Corner first up
01:13:06.000 SpaceX successfully rescued two
01:13:08.320 astronauts and when they landed there
01:13:10.239 were Dolphins breaching around the
01:13:13.080 capsule was absolutely magical to see
01:13:16.239 congratulations to the SpaceX team on
01:13:18.440 that and then Firefly Aerospace
01:13:20.920 completed its moon mission after
01:13:22.639 achieving the first commercial soft
01:13:24.600 mooner Landing take it whichever way you
01:13:27.360 want freeberg which one of these do you
01:13:28.920 want to start with and and then uh maybe
01:13:31.080 we'll we'll open the discussion up to a
01:13:32.719 little bit broader discussion about the
01:13:34.480 moon itself SpaceX was able to rescue
01:13:38.679 the the two astronauts that were
01:13:41.080 stranded by the Boeing Starliner debacle
01:13:43.400 nine months ago we talked about it on
01:13:44.960 the show you can go back
01:13:47.000 and 192 192 in August episode 192 yeah
01:13:51.719 and so having spent far more on the
01:13:54.440 Starliner program then on the crew
01:13:58.080 Dragon program the Starliner program is
01:14:00.159 gone now it's basically done and the
01:14:02.760 crew Dragon program has now done 16
01:14:05.679 crude flights to space 11 for NASA four
01:14:10.320 private commercial
01:14:12.560 flights and continues to perform so
01:14:15.120 congratulations to the SpaceX team on
01:14:17.360 making it to ISS and bringing the
01:14:19.360 astronauts home another successful
01:14:21.840 mission for SpaceX you know there's a
01:14:24.199 lot of hand ringing oh my God you know
01:14:26.360 conflict of interest Elon with SpaceX
01:14:28.960 and Doge and being close to the um
01:14:32.639 Administration when we look at what
01:14:35.040 SpaceX has accomplished I'm not a
01:14:36.600 shareholder but I know you are chamath
01:14:38.360 I'm not sure the other folks in the
01:14:39.480 panel you are as well saying I am as
01:14:41.400 well okay congratulations everybody but
01:14:44.280 putting aside the our personal
01:14:46.840 Investments when you look at how much
01:14:48.800 they've redu the cost is anybody even
01:14:51.719 close to matching their cost to getting
01:14:53.960 to space great because this kind of like
01:14:56.800 takes out the whole the the whole hand
01:15:00.159 ringing around the conflict of interest
01:15:01.960 with SpaceX both on Starling and on this
01:15:05.560 seems ridiculous because the price is so
01:15:07.800 cheap it it makes no sense to even
01:15:09.960 complain about we should just be giving
01:15:11.480 Elon a high five and saying thanks for
01:15:12.960 charging us such a low rate it's a great
01:15:16.000 question uh s you want to take it well
01:15:19.000 you know obviously Boeing is the big
01:15:21.000 loser here you probably gota you know
01:15:23.520 it's interesting to me how bad they just
01:15:26.040 fumbled this and then there's the
01:15:27.760 political element I don't know if we
01:15:28.880 want to get into it about how we weren't
01:15:31.719 able to save these astronauts and they
01:15:33.159 were stuck up there you know we we were
01:15:35.000 seeing it Landing in the water but what
01:15:36.440 you're not seeing is they couldn't walk
01:15:37.800 when they got out and they were only
01:15:38.880 supposed to be there for what like 10
01:15:40.480 days yeah and eight days and it ended up
01:15:43.520 eight months or something yeah eight
01:15:44.760 months which is horrendous because one
01:15:47.320 of the things that I believe that
01:15:49.000 America stands for is we don't leave
01:15:50.760 people like that and it's an American
01:15:52.960 issue not a political one
01:15:55.560 and so there's no reason why we
01:15:57.239 shouldn't have engaged SpaceX sooner it
01:15:59.159 was offered and they turned it into a
01:16:01.320 completely political issue and Boeing
01:16:02.960 fumbled the ball really well so you know
01:16:05.560 I I think hopefully this is a message
01:16:08.120 that's loud and clear and one of the
01:16:09.520 things I'm so excited about is little
01:16:11.280 kids watching this and seeing this and
01:16:14.040 what it means for the future of our
01:16:15.400 country because they're looking up to
01:16:17.280 people like Elon and they're going to be
01:16:18.840 the next political class in the future
01:16:21.679 and that will matter you know this is
01:16:23.239 the equivalent of moonlanding
01:16:25.639 and to see somebody in private
01:16:27.520 Enterprise do what Elon has done is just
01:16:29.679 outstanding so that's basically my
01:16:31.920 comment on it any thoughts on the cost
01:16:33.840 versus conflict of interest I guess hand
01:16:36.000 ringing look there's there's a couple of
01:16:38.159 startup Alternatives I'll put
01:16:40.280 Alternatives in quotes because they're
01:16:41.880 not really GA they're not generally
01:16:44.560 available they're not really launching
01:16:46.080 they're still in this early
01:16:47.480 experimentation phase one is blue origin
01:16:49.440 and the second is relativity space the
01:16:52.440 problem
01:16:53.400 with both of those two approaches well
01:16:55.960 the the feature of both of those two
01:16:57.679 approaches is theoretically that there's
01:16:59.400 a different economic model there but the
01:17:02.560 reality is that SpaceX is the only
01:17:04.920 company that has consistently been able
01:17:06.639 to take these costs and just crunch them
01:17:09.360 down to like more than one launch a
01:17:13.040 day this year I think like it's just an
01:17:15.400 incredible scale and pace so no there is
01:17:18.639 no economic alternative they are the
01:17:20.639 absolute cheapest in the market I mean
01:17:23.000 I'll tell you a very quick story I was
01:17:24.520 also an investor in relativity I think I
01:17:27.719 owned about 10% of the company and I
01:17:30.400 just got recapped out of that business
01:17:32.840 because they needed a lot more money
01:17:34.280 than folks were willing to give it and
01:17:35.719 then Eric Schmidt just stepped up and
01:17:37.440 offered I think3 billion to the business
01:17:40.560 and I kind of said no I'm I'm done I'm
01:17:42.679 out of here so you know Recaps are
01:17:44.320 painful you put all that money in I
01:17:46.440 think I took like a $380 million loss it
01:17:48.520 was not it was not a good week two weeks
01:17:50.120 ago but anyways that's not the point the
01:17:51.960 point is SpaceX is the best there is
01:17:54.960 nobody even close the next closest
01:17:57.639 alternative is years and years away
01:17:59.840 would we benefit from more capacity sure
01:18:02.800 but the reality is they are the only
01:18:05.120 solution and they're safe and they're
01:18:07.520 reliable and what cyan said is so true
01:18:10.560 when the hell does America just abandon
01:18:12.840 people why why do you why do you do that
01:18:16.360 especially in space of all places all
01:18:20.400 places I mean that that is really think
01:18:23.400 this be a mark Watney story like the
01:18:25.320 Martian like he would look WNBA you have
01:18:28.600 WNBA players that get put in Russian
01:18:30.600 jail we're willing to swap them for arms
01:18:32.960 dealers in the last Administration
01:18:35.360 pretty good yeah yeah fine so we didn't
01:18:38.960 abandon her but then we let these two
01:18:41.760 people
01:18:42.600 flounder I just think it's really
01:18:44.400 inexcusable that makes no sense there
01:18:46.440 definitely needs to be an investigation
01:18:47.719 into what happened there a lot of
01:18:50.280 speculation it doesn't look good I'm
01:18:52.719 gonna take elon's word that he offered I
01:18:54.880 mean I don't see any reason why he would
01:18:56.600 the astronauts even confirmed that he
01:18:58.360 offered oh they did okay yeah I mean I
01:19:00.000 know that people were saying like
01:19:01.560 unconfirmed if the Biden administ
01:19:03.600 confirmed they were like that's their
01:19:05.800 way of saying come get me yeah please
01:19:08.000 come get me they're like I'm literally
01:19:09.520 withering away in space please come get
01:19:11.360 me they put their thumbs up okay come
01:19:13.880 pick us up freeberg tell take us to the
01:19:16.360 next story and then we get we get a wrap
01:19:19.199 here this is basically what I think is
01:19:21.400 going to end up being the story over the
01:19:22.960 next couple of years is the space race
01:19:25.639 between effectively spacex's platform
01:19:28.280 and technology versus China which has
01:19:31.320 effectively ripped off SpaceX as this is
01:19:34.560 kind of being described here in this
01:19:35.880 article so you can kind of take a look
01:19:37.679 at the Long March 9 rocket is what they
01:19:41.000 call it fully reusable first stage
01:19:43.760 powered by 30 of their particular
01:19:46.600 engines which is comparable to spacex's
01:19:49.600 First Stage being powered by 33 Raptor
01:19:52.120 engines also fueled with methane and
01:19:54.360 liquid oxygen each with a Thrust of
01:19:56.320 about 280 tons compared to the Chinese
01:19:58.679 at 200 tons this is kind of a very kind
01:20:01.840 of equivalent design or here's a look at
01:20:04.600 it yeah there's the model of the
01:20:06.719 reusable yeah so this is the Long March
01:20:08.880 N9 this is their super heavy lift rocket
01:20:11.639 that they kind of first started talking
01:20:13.080 about call it a decade ago the rocket
01:20:15.520 has three stages solid Motors they've
01:20:18.040 recalibrated the design and it
01:20:19.679 effectively has now kind of become a
01:20:21.880 clone of Starship
01:20:24.880 and so this whole system is going to be
01:20:26.719 the big race and as we know the way the
01:20:28.639 Chinese operate when it comes to kind of
01:20:30.800 industrialization is they can move fast
01:20:32.719 they can move big they can move heavy
01:20:34.719 they can dedicate resources they can
01:20:36.400 dedicate an entirely vertically
01:20:37.800 integrated supply chain to achieving an
01:20:40.040 objective so this will end up being kind
01:20:42.320 of I think the big race over the next
01:20:43.600 couple of years slave
01:20:45.120 labor they've got a lot of resources at
01:20:47.400 their fingertips you can kind of say
01:20:49.400 that but I I don't know you know a lot
01:20:50.840 of people use slave labor in China as
01:20:53.719 kind of a handwavy way of describing
01:20:55.719 their competitive Advantage but I I
01:20:58.040 think this is really important China has
01:21:00.560 actually much more of an advantage in
01:21:02.199 Automation and so if you look at many
01:21:04.360 Chinese factories that everyone assumes
01:21:06.320 are cheap because they have cheap slave
01:21:08.639 labor which is kind of the western
01:21:10.840 General kind of media perception of what
01:21:12.760 goes on over there there's actually a
01:21:15.080 lot of Automation and Engineering that's
01:21:16.960 gone into building these systems that
01:21:19.159 allow them to have much higher
01:21:20.280 throughput at much lower cost um and I
01:21:22.960 think that this is a really kind of key
01:21:24.679 point that the Chinese kind of
01:21:26.639 industrial base and their manufacturing
01:21:28.400 base is so superior to the United States
01:21:31.120 in this moment in time that the US has
01:21:33.679 to figure out a way to build its
01:21:35.400 manufacturing base up to be competitive
01:21:37.679 in an age of automation not on a kind of
01:21:39.880 Labor to labor system but on a system of
01:21:42.880 production a system of production basis
01:21:45.159 and so this is really where we are
01:21:46.600 lagging deeply as a country and it as
01:21:49.199 part of you saw JD Vance's speech this
01:21:51.040 week on revitalizing kind of
01:21:53.120 manufacturing in the United States
01:21:55.159 but it has to be Advanced manufacturing
01:21:56.920 it's not just about opening a warehouse
01:21:58.159 and putting which means robots not
01:22:00.080 humans in it because it means both it
01:22:02.199 means both but it's about smarter
01:22:04.040 systems it's about designs on how you do
01:22:06.480 um
01:22:07.480 manufacturing it's about using new
01:22:09.719 things like 3D printing like automation
01:22:12.639 coupled with great Labor coupled with
01:22:14.639 great people working but it's about
01:22:17.199 designing entirely new ways of doing
01:22:18.679 manufacturing and we've stalled out over
01:22:20.360 the last three decades in the United
01:22:21.719 States as we globalized and we handed
01:22:23.920 off all man manufacturing to the East
01:22:26.440 and the United States basically just
01:22:28.000 imported manufactured goods while they
01:22:29.800 invested in all of the infrastructure to
01:22:31.560 to deliver Advanced manufacturing at
01:22:33.920 scale um and so we've got a lot of
01:22:35.800 catching up to do otherwise China will
01:22:38.280 get ahead of us in any product faster
01:22:40.719 than we will ever be able to kind of
01:22:42.120 stay ahead of the game on and I think
01:22:43.639 we're seeing that in the Space Race now
01:22:45.040 and it's definitely worth taking note
01:22:46.800 that this is kind of One Core example of
01:22:49.080 this advantage that they've developed
01:22:50.320 for themselves I'm concerned about the
01:22:52.159 cultural stuff of this like America so
01:22:54.880 ill equipped especially with this wave
01:22:56.880 of the last eight years of Dei and and
01:23:00.440 how it's infiltrated all of our
01:23:01.719 institutions and how we raise our
01:23:03.639 children in this country like we taught
01:23:05.639 them that math is racist while China is
01:23:09.000 you know their kids are the leaders in
01:23:11.480 AI you know deep seek should show us
01:23:13.600 that you know we have underestimated
01:23:15.120 China every step of the way and and I
01:23:18.360 think it's just a
01:23:19.960 tragedy you know I'm working on a a book
01:23:22.400 that's coming out called the war on
01:23:23.920 science which will actually
01:23:25.639 expose a friend of mine wrote it it's a
01:23:28.000 collection of essays exposes just how
01:23:30.000 entrenched this became in every
01:23:31.800 institution from Medical Science Etc
01:23:34.639 like how do we recover from that is how
01:23:37.480 we can compete with China because
01:23:39.080 otherwise we can't you know I really
01:23:41.239 honestly don't understand how we're
01:23:42.560 going to do it if we don't and part of
01:23:44.239 it is seeing these space launches you
01:23:45.880 know obviously the next generation of
01:23:47.440 children will be inspired by that but we
01:23:49.760 have a gap of about 8 to 10 years where
01:23:51.840 we lost that Advantage I mean it's San
01:23:54.600 Francisco we saw it up close and
01:23:55.880 personal right they banned AP math I
01:23:58.840 mean what
01:23:59.880 lunatics could ever I mean I guess the
01:24:02.600 lunatics in San Francisco could
01:24:04.520 literally justify that it was you know
01:24:08.120 some massive inequality that the smart
01:24:10.760 kids got to take harder courses Flash
01:24:13.080 the thing P from NBC Nick we know who
01:24:15.400 was responsible for it are you blaming
01:24:17.520 white women college educated white women
01:24:20.080 I'm just saying look at the data okay
01:24:22.440 what what what is going on here
01:24:24.840 like for those of you not watching it's
01:24:27.639 uh voter's opinion white men no degree
01:24:30.320 white men college degree white women no
01:24:32.400 degree white women college degree and
01:24:35.040 yeah
01:24:37.400 Dei plus 53 plus 31 by the way for white
01:24:41.280 women in college yeah NBC News poll yeah
01:24:43.800 this is not from uh yeah like a right
01:24:47.159 organization here just to build on what
01:24:48.920 you were saying yeah it's math that was
01:24:52.639 told was racist in one of the best
01:24:55.280 private schools here in in Silicon
01:24:57.040 Valley they taught the girls these are
01:24:58.920 girls in the best all girls private
01:25:00.800 school in Silicon Valley that reading
01:25:03.199 was racist could you imagine there was a
01:25:07.040 spreadsheet that these kids had to
01:25:09.080 memorize every day that had every other
01:25:11.560 kid's
01:25:12.760 pronoun and if you didn't get it right
01:25:14.679 you'd get in trouble oh yeah well not
01:25:16.920 only that but they are taught that
01:25:18.840 you're either an oppressor or you're
01:25:20.239 oppressed and there's no other option
01:25:22.400 and so like if you go to one of these
01:25:23.800 private night schools then you're
01:25:25.320 automatically an oppressor so think
01:25:27.480 about that if you're a kid and you're
01:25:29.280 you're born bad inherently Bad Evil from
01:25:33.199 birth what does that do what does that
01:25:35.719 do what does that do to your self worth
01:25:37.480 yeah your desire to actually do anything
01:25:40.440 in societ we have to fix that I actually
01:25:42.080 think it's one of the number one issues
01:25:43.360 in our country is to get
01:25:45.440 kids excited about being Americans again
01:25:48.719 you know we were talking about the
01:25:49.719 Democrat Party uh They Don't Love
01:25:53.400 America on the far left they hate
01:25:55.520 America and they're very loud and vocal
01:25:57.520 about it and so I'm glad that their you
01:26:00.040 know their base is shrinking but it
01:26:01.920 needs to shrink further and we need to
01:26:04.000 have more unifying messages and I think
01:26:05.880 SpaceX could be one of those unifying
01:26:07.880 messages yeah where we bring people
01:26:09.960 together and we encourage kids to think
01:26:12.000 bigger about the future I'll tell you
01:26:14.119 one anecdote I have been hanging out at
01:26:16.840 UT a little bit the University of
01:26:19.560 Texas and go long horns and uh I've had
01:26:24.560 three or four people of means I'll say
01:26:27.400 you know people who could afford to go
01:26:28.880 to any college ask me do you have any
01:26:31.360 hookups at UT I want to take a tour I
01:26:33.239 want to check this out and I'm like oh
01:26:35.480 and they're like yeah I just don't want
01:26:36.840 to send my kids to you know these as
01:26:39.760 chamat has called them previously on the
01:26:41.280 program W madra says I want to send them
01:26:44.080 to the South to be educated in Texas or
01:26:48.639 somewhere you know where they're not
01:26:50.080 going to learn to be part of Hamas or
01:26:53.360 you know Al-Qaeda so there you have it
01:26:56.040 folks send your kids uh yeah yeah send
01:26:59.119 them to a place that values Free Speech
01:27:01.280 look there first look at the fire rating
01:27:03.400 and then that should tell you everything
01:27:04.560 you need to know it's it's a it's a huge
01:27:07.600 Trend it's a huge Trend that people want
01:27:09.520 to go to these schools getting back on
01:27:11.560 track I'll just give a quick shout out
01:27:13.520 as well to Firefly the blue Ghost lunar
01:27:16.440 lander landed on March 2nd lasted on the
01:27:19.480 lunar surface for 14 days launched on
01:27:21.639 January 15th they are launching two
01:27:23.639 additional misss mission 2 and Mission 3
01:27:26.360 mission 2 is going to launch in 2026
01:27:28.679 back to the moon 28 for Mission 3 all of
01:27:32.639 which are doing kind of geologic
01:27:34.440 surveying of the lunar surface obviously
01:27:37.040 the long-term goal here is can we
01:27:39.679 establish a
01:27:43.199 bason mission five is going directly to
01:27:46.800 your
01:27:48.440 dingleberries they're going to go to get
01:27:51.719 those dingleberries those vegan
01:27:53.280 dingleberries
01:27:55.159 you shouldn't have heard that we just
01:27:56.239 say fine I don't care it's our tradition
01:27:58.080 to talk about an I have a 13-year-old
01:28:01.679 boy since of humor I it's fine you do
01:28:04.440 you always have actually would would you
01:28:06.400 guys be willing to go to the moon for a
01:28:09.560 week would that be something you guys
01:28:11.239 would be interested in going I talk to
01:28:13.360 my guy you got a guy I'm going I'm got a
01:28:17.040 guy I talk to my guy he said I could go
01:28:18.679 out with him so do you guys have an
01:28:20.280 interest in that like is that something
01:28:21.520 that you'd be motivated to% 100% 100%
01:28:25.000 going to do it when I'm 7 sure it's a
01:28:26.760 great question about a week a week seems
01:28:28.440 like a very wow I would go for a month
01:28:31.800 what about a day like just a lunar day
01:28:33.880 like you go there like a lunar picnic
01:28:35.400 yes yes a little picnic and then you
01:28:36.880 come back yeah what would you bring what
01:28:38.440 are you gonna bring you bring a little
01:28:39.320 chardonay what are you thinking would be
01:28:40.840 would pair well with the Dark Side of
01:28:42.520 the Moon there jth what are you gonna
01:28:43.840 bring I'd bring like a what what should
01:28:47.040 Sean make us when we go 2020 Leon I'd
01:28:49.639 bring like a white burgundy got it Nick
01:28:52.199 can you make an image of Chim on the
01:28:54.280 drinking wine can you figure out a way
01:28:55.719 to do that please thank you and what
01:28:57.560 what should we serve on the moon what
01:28:59.199 would be would you think we should go
01:29:00.520 with fish a little syrup and tur maybe
01:29:02.679 surf and turf would be good you know
01:29:04.639 people don't realize that white burgundy
01:29:06.600 tastes great with meat I know that
01:29:09.199 people think you should always drink a
01:29:10.600 very heavy red but it's not true I just
01:29:13.480 want everybody to know the more you know
01:29:15.719 the more you know thanks for tuning in

00:03:27.440 gross not for me okay okay yeah by the
00:03:29.560 way want to hear a quick science corner
00:03:31.239 so you know how we talked about yamanaka
00:03:33.720 factors there's a roaring
00:03:37.360 yes wow he's like yeah I don't care Andy
00:03:41.000 this is anyway sure let me let me let me
00:03:43.799 hit this real quick because I know we're
00:03:45.040 never goingon to get to it because you
00:03:46.120 guys just [ __ ] around talking about
00:03:48.319 politics science talk
00:03:50.360 Shel usit us you know how you can use
00:03:53.040 yanaka factors we talked about these to
00:03:55.720 basically turn a cell into a stem cell
00:03:58.000 right of course what goes on the lab
00:04:00.159 Andrew you're familiar with the yamanaka
00:04:01.760 everybody knows about the yamanaka
00:04:03.599 factors you've been all over it for a
00:04:05.200 while dude I've seen squid game yeah
00:04:08.799 absolutely now there's you think I don't
00:04:11.079 know about the yamanaka factor come
00:04:13.040 we're not gonna get I can tell you we're
00:04:14.439 not yamanaka Factor everybody knows you
00:04:17.519 didn't visit the yamanaka factory when
00:04:19.279 you were in Koto I went to the yamanaka
00:04:21.759 factory and I swear to God I guy showed
00:04:23.360 up 15 minutes late and he stabbed
00:04:25.199 himself in the stomach right there right
00:04:27.520 there he killed himself right there yeah
00:04:29.360 it's called s exactly s Soko in under a
00:04:35.800 minute okay never mind we'll come back
00:04:38.240 to
00:04:40.680 theal so the interesting work going on
00:04:43.240 right now is you basically can take any
00:04:45.520 cell from a person's body turn it into a
00:04:48.479 stem cell and then turn that stem cell
00:04:50.919 ultimately into an egg cell so you no
00:04:53.320 longer need to go Harvest eggs and so
00:04:55.759 you don't need to actually go get the
00:04:57.280 eggs from the woman you can make eggs
00:05:00.000 from skin cells for example so in the
00:05:02.479 next couple of years there's you know
00:05:04.120 there's a few little technical
00:05:05.160 breakthroughs that are happening right
00:05:06.360 now that will enable this where F
00:05:08.479 fertility clinics may end up just taking
00:05:10.720 a little bit of your skin cell creating
00:05:12.720 stem cells creating egg cells and that's
00:05:14.560 how we're going to end up doing IVF in
00:05:16.120 the future at any age so you can make
00:05:18.360 eggs at any age and you can ultimately
00:05:21.240 produce Offspring at any age you don't
00:05:23.080 need to actually have active healthy
00:05:24.520 eggs and this you like that one right
00:05:28.560 fantastic because this is a work around
00:05:30.160 for the people that are trying to uh ban
00:05:33.240 IVF because of the abortion protocol
00:05:36.160 they're Bas because they basically light
00:05:37.720 Bel uh begins a conception is part of
00:05:39.919 their belief right but and the idea you
00:05:42.199 could take one egg cell you could take
00:05:43.520 one SP make a fered egg yeah but those
00:05:46.319 people don't know but like what you do
00:05:47.280 with IVF is you try to harvest as many
00:05:49.000 as you possibly can because not all of
00:05:50.560 them are viable and it's a pretty brutal
00:05:52.840 process for the woman to go through but
00:05:54.240 if you could just grab something from
00:05:55.560 the skin you'd have almost unlimited
00:05:58.039 when a woman is born she has all her
00:05:59.639 eggs in her body and as she ages those
00:06:02.240 eggs get depleted and eventually she
00:06:04.000 doesn't have very good viable eggs left
00:06:05.560 over so this gets around that problem of
00:06:08.319 not having viable eggs we can be very
00:06:10.080 selective about the eggs and so there's
00:06:12.000 a future here in the next couple of
00:06:13.599 years where fertility becomes a simpler
00:06:16.599 hopefully easier and more widely
00:06:19.400 available service than it is today where
00:06:21.919 it's really challenging technically and
00:06:23.400 you've got to go do something that's
00:06:25.080 invasive and you know you've got to hope
00:06:27.440 that there's good healthy eggs and
00:06:28.639 there's a good number of eggs and so on
00:06:29.919 and so forth so really interesting
00:06:31.680 awesome this is awesome SCH did they sit
00:06:33.919 you down and give you like the embryos
00:06:36.759 that that were viable in the grades and
00:06:39.199 the gender and you pick one and what did
00:06:40.919 you pick we just pick the best so this
00:06:43.240 is a lot of pressure on that first one
00:06:44.800 like all the other kids afterwards I
00:06:46.360 feel like don't have as much yeah come
00:06:48.759 out of the gate strong have a good first
00:06:50.319 quarter and then whatever 100% it's all
00:06:52.800 good so I gotta ask you wait you didn't
00:06:55.599 say if you had I was about to I'm about
00:06:57.160 to put it out there I didn't have IVF
00:06:59.840 okay but the first time we had the first
00:07:03.800 kid wife says hey we're ovul I'm
00:07:06.160 ovulating I said put me in the game boom
00:07:08.240 first shot half court logo pregnant wow
00:07:11.319 bang then she says I want to wait before
00:07:14.039 I have the next one you know it's a
00:07:15.000 little traumatic to have a kid and she
00:07:16.840 waits six years then we try for a year
00:07:19.840 nothing for one year so now I'm like man
00:07:22.759 we waited too long it's a lot of
00:07:24.199 pressure you you talk about this in the
00:07:25.759 special it's like for women this is
00:07:27.960 anxiety producing so she's like you you
00:07:29.560 got to go get checked out and this is
00:07:31.879 when the most humiliating day of my life
00:07:34.560 occurred I don't know Andy what what it
00:07:36.240 was like when you went but uh they found
00:07:39.759 all these grifters can they can they
00:07:41.199 identify grifters through the microscope
00:07:42.879 no no no I walk in and the thing opens
00:07:45.400 and there's three women at the counter
00:07:47.280 at at the reception and they're like hey
00:07:49.199 Jason calacanis you're here to give a
00:07:51.360 you know to and I'm like yeah I
00:07:53.319 am and then they walk you to a room oh
00:07:55.840 that's the spookiest thing yeah yeah
00:07:57.440 they walk you to a room and then they
00:07:58.599 open it up and it's like some nightmare
00:08:01.080 scenario where there's a Motel Eight
00:08:04.400 room and there's a couch that's about
00:08:07.639 three feet three feet wide and there's a
00:08:09.639 towel on it and there's a towel on it
00:08:11.360 and that sofa is not cloth for a reason
00:08:14.680 no it needs to be cleanable it needs
00:08:17.560 to fact looks very much like the hotel
00:08:20.000 you're in shelsea I don't know what's
00:08:21.360 going on with the Netflix budget why
00:08:23.080 think maybe they could put you in the
00:08:24.479 Four Seasons or the peninsula it's so
00:08:26.879 brutal so you did this right you had go
00:08:30.120 the grainy television with the porn it's
00:08:31.879 like oh you're lucky you got the TV I
00:08:33.559 had I went to the phone I went to the
00:08:35.279 phone I I had no nothing I didn't even
00:08:38.958 have have any service in there which was
00:08:40.719 like another thing that was it was
00:08:42.159 annoying so what did you do you roll
00:08:43.360 itex it no spank bank you have to go
00:08:46.200 that's what I'm talking about the
00:08:46.920 Rolodex you roll through all the
00:08:48.360 memories think about the memories man of
00:08:50.480 my wife and only my wife nobody else
00:08:53.320 that's was all those great moments with
00:08:55.839 your wife all those great moments maybe
00:08:57.720 there was accidentally one or two that
00:09:00.120 got left in from when you were on the
00:09:01.399 road it's possible some like absolute
00:09:04.320 would jump into the dreams that I had
00:09:06.519 with my wife that might be possible I
00:09:08.720 would never want them to be there but
00:09:10.279 obviously now it's the director's C
00:09:11.560 there's nothing I could do but yeah it's
00:09:13.240 it is also funny how like we dramatize
00:09:15.399 our experience we got the easiest thing
00:09:17.320 to do in the whole thing we just got to
00:09:18.800 go into a room and jerk off as if that's
00:09:20.560 hard for us but we're like the room is
00:09:23.399 destitute and brutalist and the the
00:09:26.160 furniture was
00:09:27.800 uncomfortable you
00:09:30.399 speaking of jerk offs uh yeah speaking
00:09:33.800 of jerk offs Kavin new's got a podcast
00:09:37.040 this is uh so I think that this is like
00:09:40.839 this is a great idea despite what you
00:09:43.000 think about his politics is he a plastic
00:09:45.920 bag in the wind yes but it is a great
00:09:49.000 demonstration of like how Americans
00:09:52.360 admire bravery or courage and we don't
00:09:56.360 like [ __ ] and I think that's what the
00:09:57.720 Democrats kind of displayed in the last
00:09:59.519 I don't want to get too political about
00:10:00.800 this like no right your opinion one
00:10:03.000 man's opin it's more just like I I
00:10:04.760 respond just culturally I don't give a
00:10:06.360 about the tribalism and politics but
00:10:07.640 I'll just be honest with you so having
00:10:09.720 him have like Charlie Kirk right there
00:10:11.920 who's like a professional arguer that he
00:10:14.399 is whatever you know how like some
00:10:16.200 people are like autistic for dinosaurs
00:10:18.279 he's that for arguing right and to like
00:10:21.320 sit across from him to even address The
00:10:24.079 French
00:10:25.200 Laundry I was like okay this is actually
00:10:28.640 the right thing thing to do so as as as
00:10:31.760 easy as it is for us to sit here and go
00:10:33.519 okay this guy want just wants to be
00:10:34.760 president like this is a dumb thing like
00:10:36.839 blah blah blah it's actually what the
00:10:38.920 Democrats should be doing so I think we
00:10:41.079 need to
00:10:42.200 reward I think we need to reward this
00:10:44.399 Behavior we want more conversation we
00:10:47.800 want conversation with people especially
00:10:49.399 that like you may disagree with and like
00:10:52.320 the second podcast he put out I thought
00:10:54.160 was the most impactful there was one
00:10:56.200 piece that was incredibly impactful he's
00:10:57.800 talking to some guy I don't know who he
00:10:59.040 was some guy grew up in like San
00:11:00.519 Francisco he's
00:11:02.399 like you know he was talking about the
00:11:05.279 taxes and like he's paying all this
00:11:06.639 money in taxes in California and what
00:11:08.560 does he get from it and then Newsome
00:11:10.639 said that like yeah rich people are
00:11:12.720 going to pay more but your actual like
00:11:14.880 functional tax rate if you're middle
00:11:16.839 class would be more if you lived in
00:11:18.760 Florida because of the other stuff you
00:11:21.200 get taxed
00:11:22.639 on this is the type of information that
00:11:25.399 like you guys might be privy to but the
00:11:27.040 average person doesn't they hop on an
00:11:28.680 inter like being human and addressing
00:11:31.480 real issues instead of like culture War
00:11:34.200 issues and just talking like I think
00:11:37.000 he's going culture War like that's
00:11:38.440 culture War but he's actually putting
00:11:40.800 out valuable information that defends
00:11:44.480 the positions he may have taken in
00:11:46.240 government that the average person
00:11:47.760 doesn't really know like the average
00:11:49.079 person like me just goes all right I'm
00:11:50.519 in New York I'm getting clipped at 50%
00:11:52.680 and 5% city tax like I'm getting crushed
00:11:55.920 but if I lived in Florida or Texas I'd
00:11:57.720 save 133% and it be a complete wash when
00:12:01.560 there might be someone making 50 Grand a
00:12:03.000 year and they move from California to
00:12:05.200 Texas and they lose money and they don't
00:12:06.959 know that because they're just listening
00:12:08.480 to Rich guys on podcast talk about how
00:12:10.000 much money they save when they move to
00:12:11.120 Texas well you don't have to take a shot
00:12:12.600 at us but yeah okay A little personal I
00:12:15.079 moved to Texas this year it's more of a
00:12:16.480 shot at me and freeberg but go okay uh
00:12:19.639 Cham your thoughts on Gavin's new
00:12:22.639 podcast what do you think you you know
00:12:24.160 you were there was famously a little um
00:12:26.560 dip of the toe where somebody made a a a
00:12:28.800 podcast I'm sorry a landing page that
00:12:30.480 you were going to run for governor we we
00:12:31.880 had a little fun with that what do you
00:12:33.320 think of Gavin what do you think of his
00:12:34.920 podcast I think he's an excellent
00:12:36.720 politician it's clear he's starting the
00:12:38.880 2028 campaign okay I think he's done a
00:12:41.959 really good job so far I think Schulz is
00:12:43.800 right he is
00:12:46.040 unwinding all of
00:12:49.240 the kind of like landmines that the
00:12:51.639 Democrats have stepped on I think he's
00:12:54.320 learned what Kamala did wrong and now
00:12:57.279 he's taking this very narrow path which
00:12:59.320 is like I'm going to basically disavow
00:13:02.959 all the stuff that people don't care
00:13:04.320 about so all the gender woke ideology
00:13:07.399 stuff I don't think you're going to hear
00:13:08.519 him talk about he'll try to drive a
00:13:10.959 narrow wedge on these economic issues so
00:13:14.000 I don't know I mean I think it's going
00:13:16.079 to create a really Dynamic 2028 campaign
00:13:18.440 if he gets momentum by the way his
00:13:21.040 popularity has gone up which is insane
00:13:24.360 which after the fires and all of the
00:13:27.120 ineptitude in California all of the
00:13:30.000 corporations that have run away all of
00:13:31.639 the people that have left the chaos in
00:13:33.600 San
00:13:34.680 Francisco after all of that he started a
00:13:37.760 podcast and his popularity's gone up
00:13:39.480 it's really incredible coming around the
00:13:41.360 horn freeberg what do you think of Gavin
00:13:43.360 Nome look I think the podcast was
00:13:45.760 brilliant I think when I watched it I
00:13:49.000 was hooked because there were two things
00:13:51.240 that I think were critical
00:13:53.360 in how he runs it firstly is he is
00:13:58.199 showing the first time I think that I
00:14:00.759 have ever seen a Democrat do or a
00:14:03.440 republican in modern politics active
00:14:06.360 listening to the other side it seems so
00:14:08.959 crazy that this is some sort of special
00:14:11.800 event and special concept but this
00:14:14.440 active listening moment where you see a
00:14:17.480 politician it totally breaks down the
00:14:20.399 Walls where you immediately feel on
00:14:22.320 guard or on offense against that person
00:14:25.320 because if someone's actively listening
00:14:26.839 to you you actually feel like you're on
00:14:28.759 the same side somehow and you're trying
00:14:30.199 to come to a conclusion together and so
00:14:32.639 what that does is it invites the person
00:14:34.199 on the other side in this case the
00:14:35.600 audience The Listener to be with Gavin
00:14:38.279 part of the kind of coming together the
00:14:40.079 second thing I think he did that's
00:14:41.360 really brilliant is so much of the
00:14:43.800 modern political by modalism where
00:14:45.839 you're in one camp or the other means
00:14:48.320 that everything is a one or a zero you
00:14:50.320 know Andrew talked about this we're all
00:14:52.600 generally I think none of us would
00:14:54.320 consider ourselves political party
00:14:56.320 Affiliates we are all generally people
00:14:58.600 that like to to think for ourselves on a
00:15:00.120 topic or an issue and we don't care
00:15:01.959 about what party is associated but the
00:15:04.120 way modern politics has evolved is you
00:15:06.440 don't debate the topics you debate the
00:15:08.759 one or the zero because of what the
00:15:10.800 party says my party says this is the
00:15:13.160 position therefore I'm a one and you're
00:15:15.160 a zero and the other side says I'm the
00:15:18.040 one you're the zero meaning everything
00:15:19.680 has to be binary I'm completely right
00:15:21.639 you're completely wrong and I think what
00:15:23.399 Gavin has done is he's shown that these
00:15:25.440 are not ones and zeros they're 8020 or
00:15:27.959 6040 or
00:15:29.880 5545 and he's willing to acknowledge
00:15:32.440 that he's showing that you know what we
00:15:35.040 might be only 45% right and on so many
00:15:37.720 topics the Democratic party has ended up
00:15:40.199 slightly wrong they're
00:15:42.399 4555 it's not that they're a zero or a
00:15:44.839 one they're slightly off on taxes
00:15:46.880 they're slightly off on social issues
00:15:48.399 and they're off just enough that they
00:15:50.240 lost the election they're off just
00:15:52.000 enough that they lost tax breast tax
00:15:53.959 Andrew 2028 Trump's running for his
00:15:56.040 third term versus Gavin Newsome who do
00:15:57.600 you vote for I mean we gotta run it back
00:16:00.519 for a third term for Trump doubt course
00:16:03.759 uh no obviously I believe the it wasn't
00:16:06.079 a third term Gavin versus Trump who
00:16:08.279 would you go I it's it's I mean I gota
00:16:10.399 see what his like policies are and I
00:16:11.959 gota see where America is I think that
00:16:13.519 like the big misunderstanding with this
00:16:15.319 last election is that at least the
00:16:17.440 Democrats who are still trying to like
00:16:18.959 vilify these figures on the right what
00:16:21.839 they don't understand is they think that
00:16:23.399 this was like some populist election
00:16:25.040 where like people just fell in love with
00:16:26.680 Trump and they just loved it for so much
00:16:28.720 they would just do whatever he says what
00:16:30.800 I think is harder for them to Grapple
00:16:32.480 with is the
00:16:34.399 self-reflection of a rejectionist vote
00:16:38.279 so I think people rejected the
00:16:40.680 Democratic proposal 100% And they went
00:16:43.800 with what the other alternative was
00:16:45.959 which was Trump and exact correct that's
00:16:48.279 a way tougher pill to swallow you have
00:16:50.440 to look back at everything you've done
00:16:51.880 and go wow we're off we're not listening
00:16:53.839 to the people this guy listens to the
00:16:56.000 people I mean it seems like I'm fluffing
00:16:57.360 Trump here but like I would say that his
00:17:00.399 greatest skill is listening to what
00:17:02.440 people say and I think a lot of times
00:17:04.760 there's this IV league pretentiousness
00:17:08.079 in the Democratic party where it's like
00:17:09.880 we know it's better for you yeah and I
00:17:12.520 know you say you want these things you
00:17:14.000 don't really want that let us we we
00:17:16.359 we've studied and we've talked about it
00:17:17.799 in our little thought experiments in
00:17:19.319 class so we know what you
00:17:21.599 need what you just shut up condescending
00:17:24.000 it's condescending exactly so I think
00:17:26.559 that like when people go ah the food is
00:17:28.919 giving me cancer and then he appoints
00:17:31.160 the guy who says the food is bad to run
00:17:33.080 the food the American people go well
00:17:35.720 that kind of seems like a good thing I I
00:17:37.600 like that you know it it is like an
00:17:40.520 acute understanding and listening to
00:17:42.919 what people are saying and sometimes to
00:17:45.559 his disadvantage like he came out
00:17:48.360 against that um they were putting some
00:17:51.360 like tax on people who drive into
00:17:53.520 Manhattan or whatever like yeah
00:17:56.080 congestion pricing and ini pricing
00:17:58.400 initially people really rejected it
00:18:00.039 right and then uh so he was like we're
00:18:02.919 getting rid of congestion pricing and
00:18:04.679 like two weeks after they put that
00:18:06.240 congestion pricing thing everybody I
00:18:08.080 knew with a car was like this is the
00:18:10.480 greatest thing the city has yeah you can
00:18:12.000 actually move right you can take a taxi
00:18:14.080 and it's faster than government
00:18:16.600 overreach is good
00:18:19.080 bureaucracy nice like yeah you want a
00:18:21.520 car stay in the Burrows exactly so it's
00:18:24.080 you don't get a car in Manhattan explain
00:18:25.640 this to people it's a little bit
00:18:26.720 egregious I mean you and I do Jason but
00:18:28.880 Body El have it exactly Our Lives should
00:18:31.640 be different you know what I mean
00:18:32.960 absolutely absolutely but mean what's
00:18:34.760 the point of us having nice cars if we
00:18:37.120 can't drive them whenever we want yes
00:18:40.080 yes and you know we grew up at a time on
00:18:42.240 the lower e side uh you know you could
00:18:44.039 go to Tribeca we could go to Club
00:18:45.600 Limelight you could park outside the
00:18:47.000 Limelight at night you could go to
00:18:48.280 Palladium you could park on 14th Street
00:18:50.080 I park right on 14th Street okay I go
00:18:52.480 used to be a church right and then you
00:18:54.440 know I sniff pop ecstasy you do a little
00:18:57.000 whatever
00:18:58.880 the morning listen you goofballs between
00:19:01.600 your stupid mustache and your OIC turkey
00:19:03.919 neck I am
00:19:05.840 totally turkey go to something useful
00:19:09.159 are we GNA let Chamas sit there in
00:19:11.600 MacGyver's funeral outfit tell us that
00:19:14.799 we're goofballs this guy's wearing a
00:19:17.039 vest with a collar he looks like he's
00:19:18.960 going to a Punjabi wake I can't believe
00:19:21.640 that he would even talk about the way
00:19:24.000 that you're dressed and how you look
00:19:26.000 this is custom Laura piano boys this is
00:19:28.280 Laur really what does it look like you
00:19:30.520 got it at Zara all right listen um but
00:19:34.240 more importantly let's stay on track yes
00:19:35.960 yes we got to stay on track can I tell
00:19:37.159 you guys something about uh tariffs from
00:19:39.039 a Layman yes please like you guys are
00:19:41.760 cutely aware of maybe how these things
00:19:43.480 affect markets and yada yada yada and
00:19:45.320 most people don't have any [ __ ] clue
00:19:47.400 so the the the average person right I
00:19:51.280 look at this and I'm like man it kind of
00:19:54.200 sucks that you got to like negotiate
00:19:56.200 your like your bid for a car you're
00:19:58.880 going to buy publicly right so this is
00:20:01.320 my assumption and maybe I'm like a
00:20:02.440 little bit more optimistic than most
00:20:04.120 about the administration but if I go to
00:20:07.799 buy a car and the car is let's said 100K
00:20:09.600 and I go offer the guy 80
00:20:12.360 right I don't want everybody around me
00:20:15.280 yelling out like how can you insult him
00:20:17.159 by offering him 80 this is an insult and
00:20:19.120 then I I can't go to them and I go I'm
00:20:21.600 actually trying to settle it 90 I'm just
00:20:23.679 saying 80 so he comes down a little bit
00:20:26.280 but the unfortunate thing when you
00:20:27.440 litigate these things in front of the
00:20:28.679 entire world is that they look at that
00:20:30.679 first measure there 200% taxes and Trump
00:20:33.240 can't bulk at it he can't go yo I'm just
00:20:35.080 [ __ ] I'm just playing around with
00:20:36.760 that number I actually just getting them
00:20:38.080 to come down 20% or 10 getting to come
00:20:40.640 down anything is a win he can't say that
00:20:42.960 because he loses all his leverage so
00:20:44.280 he's got to sit here and then get
00:20:45.919 criticized by I don't know if it's half
00:20:47.919 the country I don't know you know who
00:20:49.159 really ends up caring about what these
00:20:50.679 tariffs do obviously they're
00:20:52.039 repercussions in the market I got a
00:20:53.720 buddy of mine building a hotel out in
00:20:55.080 Joshua Tree and he's like I don't even
00:20:56.440 know if I can get brought into the
00:20:58.159 country from Canada so it does affect
00:20:59.799 people in real time but it's impossible
00:21:01.919 to do these negotiations with any
00:21:03.640 leverage if you have the people within
00:21:05.400 your own country questioning your
00:21:07.679 ability to negotiate in real time that
00:21:09.760 is what the Layman would think well I do
00:21:12.400 think you're right in the sense that in
00:21:14.200 the early days when Trump was talking
00:21:16.559 about tariffs initially everyone was
00:21:18.120 like oh my God he's going to use tariffs
00:21:19.520 he's unpredictable and then the
00:21:22.159 narrative became he's using it as a
00:21:23.919 negotiating tactic the problem is just
00:21:26.360 like in poker once everyone knows that
00:21:28.919 there's this kind of action it's
00:21:31.000 exploitable and so this is now kind of
00:21:33.240 an exploitable mode of negotiation where
00:21:35.760 everyone now assumes he's just trying to
00:21:37.679 negotiate so no one actually takes him
00:21:39.279 seriously the question now is the
00:21:41.320 response going to be that he's going to
00:21:42.360 be serious about it or is he actually
00:21:44.880 exploitable and you saw what China's
00:21:47.000 response was I kind of view China as
00:21:48.760 like AI like stuff goes into China the
00:21:51.200 AI processes it and it comes back out
00:21:53.240 China is like obviously the way they're
00:21:55.279 kind of structured you have very little
00:21:57.080 psychosocial bias like you do with other
00:21:59.320 democratic governments it's very
00:22:01.039 systematic it's systematically processed
00:22:03.080 every piece of data is systematically
00:22:05.080 processed every action is systematically
00:22:06.799 processed and so I think when you look
00:22:08.840 at how the Chinese Ambassador responded
00:22:10.840 to Trump on Twitter a few weeks ago
00:22:13.080 where they're like you want war we'll
00:22:14.279 give you War this is a hot war or a cold
00:22:15.919 war whatever you want we've never seen
00:22:17.880 that from an ambassador to the United
00:22:19.320 States president before done on Twitter
00:22:21.440 like this let alone the Chinese
00:22:23.480 Ambassador so I think it says a lot
00:22:25.640 about how the Chinese AI is processing
00:22:28.640 the Trump negotiating tactic or the
00:22:30.200 Trump positioning statements on tariffs
00:22:32.480 which indicates that there may be now I
00:22:34.360 mean we can talk about what game theory
00:22:35.760 optimal play might be in this kind of
00:22:37.320 poker game What's going to come next but
00:22:39.720 there's a a real assessment that they've
00:22:41.320 made on how far he is willing to take it
00:22:43.600 they've got a conclusive statement and
00:22:44.919 they believe that this is the fastest
00:22:46.159 way to kind of win their negotiating
00:22:47.559 position but it says a lot about where
00:22:49.440 this is all going everyone now
00:22:51.159 understands or views this as an
00:22:52.240 exploitable moment which unfortunately
00:22:54.440 means that tariffs may not work or
00:22:55.960 they're actually going to have to stick
00:22:57.679 which can be really
00:22:59.400 yeah it could be painful could be
00:23:00.840 painful for every your thoughts on the
00:23:03.840 to and Andrew's position what is the I
00:23:06.000 think it's it's like 120 some odd years
00:23:09.080 Nick maybe you can find this tweet that
00:23:10.559 I had but almost the majority of years
00:23:14.200 as a nation or close to a majority of
00:23:16.720 the years as a
00:23:18.200 nation we had no income tax and the way
00:23:23.000 that we would fund the programs that we
00:23:25.320 needed was not from insiders but from
00:23:28.760 Outsiders and that's where the Tariff
00:23:30.840 was born right it's people domestically
00:23:33.559 in America don't pay any taxes on the
00:23:35.320 things that they do and instead if you'd
00:23:37.360 like to sell into the United States you
00:23:39.640 pay a reasonable tax so this is the so
00:23:42.039 how many years so it's 126 years from
00:23:44.720 1776 to
00:23:46.480 1861 then we paused it for a few years
00:23:49.000 because of the Civil War we restarted
00:23:51.039 again in
00:23:51.919 1872 and you notice when it stopped when
00:23:54.320 it stopped was right around World War I
00:23:56.360 where this entire War Machine broke out
00:23:58.279 and and we've never looked back so I
00:24:01.320 don't know I think that one way to think
00:24:03.240 about this is we're probably going to go
00:24:05.640 back and
00:24:07.000 Explore isn't it better if we have this
00:24:11.159 incredibly vibrant and rich country of
00:24:13.080 330 million people with a ton of
00:24:14.960 purchasing power what happens if we put
00:24:18.000 the burden not on them to fund the
00:24:21.440 American infrastructure and social
00:24:23.240 programs and safety net but if we put
00:24:25.559 the burden on all the companies in the
00:24:27.799 other seven .7 billion people in the
00:24:30.039 world in the 185 plus countries that
00:24:33.559 want access to these folks should there
00:24:35.760 be exceptions probably should there be
00:24:38.600 waivers in very specific and narrow
00:24:40.679 cases
00:24:42.360 absolutely but I think that that's where
00:24:44.480 these guys are going and I think that
00:24:46.360 you heard this by the way yesterday from
00:24:48.039 Howard lutnick I don't know if you guys
00:24:49.360 saw this but he said the Trump tax plan
00:24:51.840 is going to cut federal income taxes to
00:24:54.640 zero for anybody making 150k or less saw
00:24:57.919 that
00:24:59.039 it's crazy what would the vulnerability
00:25:00.960 in that be like putting the burden on
00:25:04.240 all of these expenses that we would
00:25:07.080 incur on other countries what would that
00:25:09.480 vulnerability for us be there are two
00:25:12.760 the first we keep the expenses that's
00:25:16.159 that's the key if we keep the tars if we
00:25:17.720 charge them to come into the market we
00:25:19.279 charge them an extra 25% but it's we we
00:25:21.440 talked about this last week if you cut
00:25:22.640 the budget then it's it can be net
00:25:24.559 neutral that's part of what they said
00:25:26.559 got it but he's saying what is the
00:25:27.720 Strategic vulnerability I think the
00:25:29.240 Strategic vulnerability is too the the
00:25:31.960 thing with tariffs is and you're
00:25:33.559 pointing out this let's just say today
00:25:36.000 you say there's a tariff and then
00:25:37.399 tomorrow you say oh we've found an
00:25:39.279 agreement and we're going to take it off
00:25:40.600 the table one piece of logic would say
00:25:43.960 wow that's great we're able to change
00:25:45.200 our mind on a dime the problem for
00:25:47.760 countries and companies is that they
00:25:50.440 can't think in 24-hour blocks of time
00:25:53.080 right they're making decisions in five
00:25:55.000 and 10 year blocks of time it's like I'm
00:25:57.000 going to go and borrow a billion
00:25:59.120 I'm going to go and build a data center
00:26:00.799 I'm going to borrow 10 billion I'm going
00:26:02.559 to build tanks once you start that you
00:26:05.640 can't just stop it and then restart it
00:26:08.679 so that's one strategic problem which is
00:26:10.640 that if you are not careful some of
00:26:13.799 these markets that are really crucial
00:26:15.799 I'll give you one which we talked about
00:26:17.279 last week right now 95% of all of the
00:26:20.440 energy we generate in America is from
00:26:22.120 Renewables whether you like it or not
00:26:24.440 that's just what it
00:26:26.159 is the reason why that's possible is
00:26:28.960 because America has a very sophisticated
00:26:31.960 Market where all these people come from
00:26:34.399 all corners of the world insurance
00:26:36.399 companies life insurance companies Banks
00:26:38.600 and they fund all of it and the reason
00:26:41.440 is they can take a tax credit they can
00:26:43.240 lower their effective tax rate they get
00:26:45.039 a higher rate of return it's all super
00:26:46.960 complicated but the point is these
00:26:48.320 incentives exist if all of a sudden
00:26:51.720 you play around with that market half
00:26:55.240 that energy would go away electricity
00:26:57.880 prices would rise inflation goes up and
00:27:00.679 then if we have to go and compete
00:27:02.760 against China for AI and a bunch of
00:27:04.559 other stuff where is the energy going to
00:27:06.200 come from you're going to Brown out
00:27:07.440 people you're going to just turn their
00:27:08.600 energy off so that you can fund a data
00:27:10.720 center so that the Tik Tock algorithm is
00:27:12.480 better that's literally what we would
00:27:13.919 have to decide so that's that's one way
00:27:17.159 and then the second way is if you're
00:27:19.760 providing a critical service or a good
00:27:22.919 to American people for which there is no
00:27:26.799 alternative that becom really
00:27:28.600 problematic because that person can then
00:27:30.279 pull that product and say I can't afford
00:27:32.080 to make it the obvious example is if you
00:27:35.200 make pharmaceutical drugs for rare
00:27:37.399 diseases what do you do and again those
00:27:39.840 are all things that are like multi-
00:27:42.159 deade long decisions yeah you'd love to
00:27:45.200 make them and unchange them at every 24
00:27:47.399 hours but it's just not possible because
00:27:49.000 like you just make these decisions and
00:27:50.320 you're stuck with them for a long time
00:27:52.360 that's where the tarff thing becomes
00:27:53.640 problematic if you change them often
00:27:55.320 enough if you implement them and you're
00:27:57.760 like this is what it's going to be the
00:28:00.039 world can adapt and people can figure it
00:28:01.720 out I mean the other problem is just the
00:28:03.640 communication of this has been terrible
00:28:05.159 we were on the program last week or two
00:28:06.880 weeks ago Joe lale is like this is about
00:28:08.600 fentanyl so is it about fenol is it
00:28:10.840 about getting rid of income tax at the
00:28:12.399 federal level is it about supply chain
00:28:14.480 resiliency these guys get like a D in my
00:28:18.559 grade book for communication it's
00:28:20.279 terrible communication and this idea
00:28:23.000 that you can't take Trump too seriously
00:28:25.720 about his claims like well he said he
00:28:28.559 was gonna overturn roie Wade he did it
00:28:30.880 he said he was gonna close the border
00:28:32.080 and send people home he did that you
00:28:34.399 know yeah he said he'd do a Muslim ban
00:28:36.200 he actually did that so for every time
00:28:38.600 he says something and you're like that's
00:28:40.440 cap no way he's going to do that I
00:28:43.640 actually think people are starting to
00:28:44.760 realize he's going to do something here
00:28:46.440 with these tariffs they're not just a
00:28:47.919 negotiating position and the other
00:28:49.960 problem I think a lot of people have
00:28:51.120 with this is it's centralize his power
00:28:53.480 anybody can go to Trump now and say I
00:28:55.360 want an exception I'm you know a car
00:28:57.480 company I want an exception I'm a Solar
00:28:59.880 Company I you know I need an exemption
00:29:01.919 and then now you've got everybody going
00:29:03.519 to Mar Lago to Kiss the Ring to give him
00:29:05.519 a donation to bow down and it
00:29:07.559 centralizes more power with them as
00:29:09.000 opposed to having rules yes and we need
00:29:11.440 to have rules in this country that apply
00:29:13.039 to everybody not just people who give a
00:29:14.840 million dollars like Bezos and Tim Cook
00:29:17.200 and everybody and Zuck The Weather Vein
00:29:19.880 gave him we don't want to live in that
00:29:21.440 world where you're just bribing Trump to
00:29:23.880 get your tariff and that's how people
00:29:25.840 feel that's how the business Community
00:29:27.440 feels that's the reality right now
00:29:29.399 people are bribing Trump giving him a
00:29:31.440 million dollars to the inauguration to
00:29:32.840 get close to him to go to Mara Lago and
00:29:34.840 it looks really bad you need to have a a
00:29:37.480 clear strategy here for what the rules
00:29:40.240 of the game are and he's changing the
00:29:42.039 rules so you have to go to him and he's
00:29:44.559 he loves that that's actually I think
00:29:46.320 what he's trying to do is get everybody
00:29:48.120 to go through him it's a really clever
00:29:49.960 hack I think yeah and perception is
00:29:52.159 reality so you have to react to people's
00:29:53.919 perception like we can throw data points
00:29:55.760 all we want at people and we can throw
00:29:57.399 research and all this other [ __ ] but if
00:29:58.840 people aren't meeting you there then
00:30:00.399 you're not going to be communicating
00:30:01.640 with them effectively and I think that
00:30:03.760 uh that's something that like you know
00:30:05.679 especially you guys need to know you
00:30:06.960 guys have pretty information that the
00:30:08.519 average American probably is not and we
00:30:11.120 can [ __ ] and complain about how they
00:30:12.559 don't read or how they're not looking up
00:30:14.399 you know what happened in 1913 to change
00:30:16.840 the course of American history and how
00:30:18.399 we started te or we can go okay we need
00:30:20.880 to find a way to disseminate this
00:30:22.279 information so that they can make these
00:30:24.240 decisions and I guess or feel
00:30:26.519 comfortable with the results of these
00:30:28.000 decisions do you think America would be
00:30:31.679 okay with this idea of taxing Outsiders
00:30:33.960 and then relying on it versus income tax
00:30:38.480 paid by its own citizens I think that
00:30:40.880 the second half is really all that would
00:30:42.480 matter I think that people are fig I
00:30:44.640 think the majority of people are
00:30:45.559 thinking about the next week so if you
00:30:47.120 say that I don't have to pay taxes like
00:30:49.559 and I think this is what Republicans are
00:30:51.240 doing way better than Democrats right
00:30:52.640 now is like Democrats don't have build
00:30:54.640 the wall they don't have slogans they
00:30:56.639 don't have things that immediately tap
00:30:58.360 into like core emotional feeling
00:31:00.080 regardless if you're going to do it or
00:31:01.320 not we want Greenland okay that's cool
00:31:03.760 Democrats need eggs or a dollar
00:31:06.039 Democrats need things that like Echo
00:31:08.480 their sentiments and how they want to
00:31:10.000 like take care of people and provide for
00:31:11.480 the disenfranchise but it has to be done
00:31:13.960 in a way where it's digestible you can
00:31:15.760 chew on it if you want to make housing
00:31:17.679 more affordable then you say yeah we're
00:31:19.000 seizing public land we're building
00:31:20.639 10,000 units like you have to tap into
00:31:23.120 what Americans need which is a feeling
00:31:25.200 of not just Comfort every American
00:31:28.200 thinks they're going to be a millionaire
00:31:29.799 that's what this country drives off of
00:31:32.159 right it's every poor American that hope
00:31:34.559 that hope yeah and the second they stop
00:31:36.799 thinking they will be they or they can
00:31:39.440 be or they can be it falls apart and
00:31:42.200 then some healthcare CE gets shot and
00:31:44.399 people celebrate they're they're
00:31:46.639 celebrating because they no longer feel
00:31:48.760 the hope that they could be in that
00:31:50.039 position yeah they feel so
00:31:52.200 disenfranchise they they and this is
00:31:54.720 what like I'm telling you like the you
00:31:56.720 guys of the world need pay close
00:31:58.559 attention to because there's going to be
00:32:00.000 no empathy if anything bad happens oh
00:32:02.440 the stock market is down no Americans
00:32:04.960 are invested in the stock market like
00:32:06.960 all you I've been saying it no no no
00:32:08.919 I've been saying this for months country
00:32:10.480 I've been saying it for months nobody
00:32:11.639 cares about the stock market nor should
00:32:13.440 we and the reason is because we people
00:32:17.080 who own these assets have overly
00:32:19.559 benefited more than we've deserved for
00:32:22.279 the last 15 years ever since the great
00:32:24.519 financial crisis in the United States
00:32:27.039 people who as Jason said could cozy up
00:32:29.840 and by the way Jason I think the the the
00:32:32.600 claim that you made which is is is
00:32:36.000 severely true for how from 2007 up until
00:32:40.200 now has played out because if you look
00:32:43.120 under all the
00:32:44.799 programs if you could have lobbied Obama
00:32:47.399 in those critical years of the GFC yep
00:32:51.000 oh my God the amount of money that was
00:32:53.360 no because we we took interest rates
00:32:55.200 literally to zero anybody like us who
00:32:57.480 could have gone and gotten levered up
00:32:59.120 and gone into the stock market was
00:33:00.600 richly rewarded and the problem is we
00:33:03.240 left everybody else behind and I think
00:33:06.000 the great thing about Trump is he is
00:33:08.880 going to reset that he is going to take
00:33:11.159 a lot of wealth away from asset holders
00:33:13.960 you're seeing it every day 500 billion
00:33:16.279 500 billion there is no sympathy I think
00:33:19.480 it's
00:33:20.679 fantastic that's that's great to it's
00:33:23.440 great to hear you even saying that
00:33:26.159 because I feel like a lot of people that
00:33:27.600 are in maybe your guys position don't
00:33:31.120 understand that disconnect and that is
00:33:33.480 important to understand there like even
00:33:35.760 what happened in the Palisades like in
00:33:37.279 LA with like the fire the second people
00:33:39.240 heard it was like rich people's houses
00:33:41.399 there was no empathy for it they didn't
00:33:43.760 a million dollar house you yeah was like
00:33:46.559 and it it is I don't even have a house I
00:33:48.480 can't find a house you burned your house
00:33:50.480 down and you move you went back you went
00:33:52.000 to your vacation house now oh I'm sorry
00:33:53.720 you're living at your ski house that's a
00:33:55.440 tragedy like literally you're right it
00:33:57.279 probably explains why we don't hear
00:33:59.080 anything in the news anymore about
00:34:00.440 anything that's happening with respect
00:34:01.799 to reconstruction or any of the disrup
00:34:05.320 it's a rich person problem people and
00:34:07.159 you know I think putting together what
00:34:08.800 you just said schultzy and and uchim off
00:34:11.839 Trump is a master at connecting with
00:34:14.079 people and listening to them I thought
00:34:16.000 the one of the greatest things he he he
00:34:19.159 he did during this last election is when
00:34:20.639 he said no tax on tips when he said no
00:34:23.040 tax on tips he was going right for
00:34:24.800 Nevada he was going right for that swing
00:34:26.839 state you know to get those those folks
00:34:28.679 who live off tips but what he was also
00:34:30.199 doing is saying I know that there's a
00:34:32.839 bunch y'all that sometimes get cash tips
00:34:35.320 you put in your pocket it's the gray
00:34:36.879 Market I get it you know I run a you
00:34:39.280 know I I got caddies who get a hyy from
00:34:41.560 you know whatever taking somebody out on
00:34:43.159 the course we're just going to make it
00:34:45.000 official you don't get tax on tips
00:34:46.440 because we know that you're you know
00:34:47.399 you're the bottom third of the country
00:34:49.679 in terms of your economic power those
00:34:51.879 kind of statements really do connect
00:34:54.040 with people Trump has just mastered this
00:34:56.280 this party is Trump is the Democratic
00:34:58.880 party that we grew up with it's kind of
00:35:00.839 crazy it's kind of crazy right and then
00:35:03.079 the Democrats became this elitist group
00:35:05.280 that seem to be in the pocket of
00:35:06.599 business interest I don't know what
00:35:07.800 Bizarro World we're living well that I
00:35:09.560 think you tapped into it right there
00:35:10.960 it's like uh I think that they they
00:35:13.800 could easily win the next election if
00:35:15.839 they made it a class war but they don't
00:35:17.960 because it feels like they're in the
00:35:19.480 pockets of these billion dollar
00:35:21.280 corporations so they can't really I mean
00:35:24.040 Bernie did it really effectively right
00:35:25.760 like this random Jew in Maine or
00:35:28.880 something like that is like yo we got to
00:35:30.720 get some money from these rich people
00:35:32.000 give it back to the poor and all of the
00:35:33.520 sudden all of America turned him into
00:35:35.800 like our surrogate grandfather so you
00:35:38.359 can and then he got shived by Hillary
00:35:40.680 and the Machine and and I mean what did
00:35:43.400 they say about his fans like they went
00:35:45.240 very specifically they're like he has a
00:35:47.599 his the Bernie Bros have a sexism and
00:35:51.079 bigotry problem right they made him
00:35:53.400 radioactive right so now you killed the
00:35:56.040 working class now the working class is
00:35:57.440 no longer supporting the Democratic
00:35:58.720 party so who do they have left they have
00:36:01.520 the identity politics groups so they
00:36:03.280 can't piss off the identity politics
00:36:04.920 groups because they're like that's all
00:36:05.880 we got left they did the same [ __ ] with
00:36:08.000 us during the election right they're
00:36:09.640 like the podcast Bros have a sexism amb
00:36:12.200 bigotry problem they they try to make
00:36:14.040 people radioactive and it's like that
00:36:15.680 card's been played so many times that
00:36:17.280 people are desens anymore I think
00:36:19.200 there's one big shoe left to drop I
00:36:21.040 think we've started the process of
00:36:22.560 really really taking a bunch of heat out
00:36:24.359 of the asset markets like equities so
00:36:26.760 we've taken trillions and trillions of
00:36:28.240 dollars of wealth away I think we're
00:36:30.280 going to take trillions more but the
00:36:32.240 next big market and this is actually
00:36:34.000 where Andrew to your point we
00:36:35.960 reestablish some hope I think for a lot
00:36:38.119 of people is we are going to whack the
00:36:40.119 housing market it's just going to happen
00:36:42.599 and let me just say something about how
00:36:44.280 is that GNA happen J explain it because
00:36:45.920 there's 7 million homes that we still
00:36:47.520 need to build to to service just current
00:36:50.280 demand how does that actually happen
00:36:51.839 with the supply demand problem in your
00:36:53.800 mind there are a bunch of mechanisms
00:36:57.319 that have to get cleaned up right now
00:37:00.359 okay so one mechanism is that there are
00:37:02.480 a whole host of mortgages that are
00:37:05.560 basically being propped up they it was a
00:37:07.920 program that's that really got out of
00:37:09.800 control under the Biden Administration
00:37:12.000 Nick you can find this article is in the
00:37:13.280 Wall Street Journal we are going to
00:37:14.920 figure out how to get these two
00:37:17.839 government related agencies Fanny May
00:37:19.839 and Freddy Mack out of what's called
00:37:21.400 conservatorship and these are the folks
00:37:23.119 that are responsible for
00:37:24.760 essentially wrapping guarantees around
00:37:27.200 mortg so that the mortgage Market can
00:37:29.480 function the details don't particularly
00:37:31.880 matter that much but the point is that
00:37:34.880 what we are doing is we are
00:37:37.760 unwittingly propping up with American
00:37:40.560 taxpayer
00:37:41.880 dollars the US housing market why is
00:37:44.880 that bad it is locking an inordinate
00:37:48.440 number of people from that first
00:37:50.800 critical step that actually makes them
00:37:52.640 feel like they are winning and they're
00:37:54.359 on their way to achieving their dreams
00:37:56.079 which is can I make a it on a home and
00:37:58.560 then can I live this out and you have
00:38:00.960 these artificially inflated prices all
00:38:04.119 around the country as a result of this
00:38:06.440 so I think this next wave is deeply
00:38:09.839 beneficial to the middle class which is
00:38:12.200 there is no reason like you guys see it
00:38:14.640 when you read The Wall Street Journal I
00:38:17.200 think it is the dumbest [ __ ] in the
00:38:18.800 world when I see an article which is
00:38:20.160 like this house just is $65 million on4
00:38:24.280 acres in some Rando place in Miami
00:38:27.640 I was thinking Malibu but yeah but what
00:38:30.760 is this this makes no sense and so when
00:38:33.560 you rationalize a bunch of equity
00:38:37.680 values and you rationalize the cost of a
00:38:41.079 home I think what you're going to do is
00:38:43.640 you're going to allow a lot more people
00:38:45.119 to find a more reasonable way to enter
00:38:46.839 the housing market and I do think that
00:38:49.000 that's a really big step in allowing
00:38:50.560 them to feel like they're part of the
00:38:51.680 dream so you lower asset prices you can
00:38:55.200 own some stocks maybe you own a 401k or
00:38:57.839 if you've never had a 41k but your
00:38:59.440 employer offers it for the first time it
00:39:02.079 may actually make Financial sense to put
00:39:03.760 a small amount of it in there you've
00:39:05.480 never been able to own a home all of a
00:39:07.240 sudden home prices are whacked 30 or 40%
00:39:09.680 you're able to do that because of how
00:39:12.119 Trump goes after the budget when his
00:39:15.079 rate of borrowing for the US government
00:39:16.760 goes down your mortgage rate goes down
00:39:18.720 now all of a sudden you can enter in
00:39:20.079 because home prices are less and you can
00:39:21.839 actually get a mortgage they may all
00:39:24.200 seem very random but they can come
00:39:26.880 together in giving 50 60 million people
00:39:30.000 a shot that they have been screaming
00:39:31.880 since the great financial crisis they
00:39:33.200 don't have this is so huge because on
00:39:35.720 like a core emotional level you want as
00:39:38.000 many Americans as possible invested in
00:39:41.720 American success and Excellence totally
00:39:44.599 and the the greater the Delta between
00:39:47.119 like them and their first home or their
00:39:48.880 first investment at stock the greater
00:39:50.960 that distance the more disillusioned
00:39:52.920 they become in America in general when
00:39:54.720 they feel like like you said earlier
00:39:56.440 like the way you guys got into the
00:39:58.160 market when you could basically take out
00:39:59.520 loans for nothing and then you saw these
00:40:01.400 incredible gains they feel left behind
00:40:03.800 the second they feel like they're in on
00:40:05.160 it they own apartment they own some
00:40:07.480 shares of Tesla that's why crypto is so
00:40:09.680 popular is because they're feel like
00:40:11.160 it's their only access I got yeah it's
00:40:13.040 like yeah it's like comedy in some ways
00:40:15.359 like all I need is a microphone or music
00:40:17.480 like there's a path for me and crypto
00:40:19.680 obviously is a giant [ __ ] scam it's a
00:40:21.560 scam Shore but I can get a piece of this
00:40:23.680 I can get a piece of this this American
00:40:25.560 dream and I would rather that they were
00:40:28.200 invested in uh you know a Vanguard
00:40:30.680 account or something like that I would
00:40:31.800 rather they're invested in the entire
00:40:33.240 Market I mean there's this this idea and
00:40:35.960 I'm sure you poke holes and tons of
00:40:37.280 holes into it and but this idea like
00:40:39.520 every American Born gets a thousand
00:40:41.560 bucks put into a friend of ours Brad
00:40:43.680 gersner with this of invest America is
00:40:45.480 the concept and regardless if the
00:40:47.280 concept is good or not the emotional
00:40:49.440 connectivity to the success of American
00:40:51.960 industry is really important when you
00:40:54.599 know at 22 that you could get this thing
00:40:56.960 that's compounding for 22 years you
00:40:59.000 could pay off some college loans you
00:41:00.359 could put something down on a house you
00:41:02.000 could pay for trade school whatever it
00:41:03.400 is I think you have a different energy
00:41:05.359 towards America and its success and then
00:41:07.720 you have a lot less of these kids who
00:41:09.079 are just like America is this horrible
00:41:10.480 place and capitalism is bad yeah
00:41:11.960 capitalism is bad when you're left
00:41:13.280 behind when you're invested in
00:41:14.920 capitalism it's the [ __ ] baby absolutely
00:41:18.119 we're on the express train let me give
00:41:19.560 you guys um I did an analysis I was I
00:41:23.160 wasn't sure if I should put it out but
00:41:24.359 I'll tell you guys the numbers
00:41:27.720 the US Social Security program is meant
00:41:30.040 to be kind of the retirement program for
00:41:32.920 folks that don't have access to private
00:41:34.480 retirement accounts okay and this
00:41:37.560 program was set up in the 1930s after
00:41:41.200 the Great Depression and there's a trust
00:41:43.800 fund the OASDI which is the the fund
00:41:46.680 that they invest to Capital so every
00:41:48.240 year we all put money in with our social
00:41:49.720 security taxes out of our paychecks goes
00:41:51.400 in there and it gets invested you know
00:41:53.119 what it gets invested
00:41:54.800 in it gets invested in one thing us
00:41:58.240 treasuries which have averaged about
00:42:00.880 4.8% return since the beginning of the
00:42:03.720 program per year meanwhile what if you
00:42:05.440 put it into the market meanwhile the S&P
00:42:07.560 has been averaging 11% so here's the
00:42:09.800 math if in 1971 which was the year that
00:42:13.000 we went off the gold standard in the
00:42:14.640 United States if we invested the Social
00:42:17.079 Security trust fund in the S&P the
00:42:19.319 balance of the Social Security trust
00:42:20.800 fund today would be $15
00:42:23.359 trillion that would be roughly onethird
00:42:25.720 of the value of the total S&P 500 which
00:42:28.640 would be jointly owned by all Americans
00:42:31.119 who took their Capital now here's what's
00:42:33.160 Fed Up what's fed up is that the middle
00:42:35.800 class people who had access to private
00:42:37.640 retirement accounts benefited by buying
00:42:39.400 the S&P 500 and the wealthy were able to
00:42:41.839 access it so all of the equity value
00:42:44.160 that accured from American Enterprise
00:42:46.119 and the prosperity of the American
00:42:47.559 system accured to the people that had
00:42:49.559 access to the private accounts meanwhile
00:42:51.000 the people that only had access to the
00:42:52.359 Public Accounts got stuck owning
00:42:54.720 treasuries today the Social Security
00:42:57.200 trust fund has $2.7 trillion balance and
00:42:59.359 based on the outflows and inflows it's
00:43:00.880 going to go bankrupt in
00:43:02.559 2032 that means Social Security is
00:43:04.839 either going to get cut or the fed's
00:43:06.599 goingon to print a ton of money to keep
00:43:07.839 Social Security benefits retirement age
00:43:09.599 goes up a little bit Yeah there a lot of
00:43:11.640 levers yeah wow so I did the math if you
00:43:14.319 assume that the S&P 500 continues to
00:43:16.520 grow at 10 and a half% a year on average
00:43:18.880 there's ups and downs and sure there
00:43:20.280 could be basically draw downs and all
00:43:21.760 these other sorts of things but here's
00:43:23.400 the important point we could put about
00:43:25.200 $500 billion in the trust fund today and
00:43:27.640 it will not go bankrupt again and it
00:43:29.440 will continue to grow every year and
00:43:31.240 then all Americans have participation in
00:43:33.839 American Enterprise and importantly this
00:43:35.839 becomes the world's largest Sovereign
00:43:37.319 wealth fund ever you don't need a
00:43:39.200 separate Sovereign wealth fund we
00:43:40.480 already have one it's it's called It's
00:43:42.800 called The Social Security trust fund
00:43:44.319 and what we've done is we've totally
00:43:46.200 mismanaged it and I went back to trying
00:43:47.720 to understand why this is the case why
00:43:49.440 have we only ever bought treasuries
00:43:51.440 early on the US needed someone to loan
00:43:53.400 money so they basically forced the
00:43:55.319 citizens to loan the government money
00:43:57.160 the form of treasuries but today the
00:43:59.400 Social Security trust fund owns only
00:44:02.000 less than 10% about 8% of the total
00:44:04.040 treasury bonds outstanding the rest are
00:44:05.880 owned by the fed and foreign investors
00:44:07.480 and private investors and others that
00:44:08.839 want to own it so why are we forcing all
00:44:10.920 the American citizens toing up for no
00:44:12.760 reason and and we're we're discouraging
00:44:15.400 access so basically we've created
00:44:17.280 through the Social Security System we've
00:44:18.880 created the Deep inequity we see in this
00:44:20.680 country If instead we had allowed the
00:44:23.480 social security system to invest in the
00:44:25.200 S&P 500 to buy American Enterprises to
00:44:28.000 fund American businesses then every
00:44:30.440 American would be wealthy and that
00:44:32.520 middle class that uniquely participated
00:44:34.720 by basically arbitraging the market
00:44:36.880 where they forced the treasury bond
00:44:38.559 yields on the poor and they got to take
00:44:40.800 access to the equity yields would have
00:44:42.559 not happened yeah they had 401ks
00:44:46.359 rightt and they were able to participate
00:44:48.440 by with brokerage accounts and buying
00:44:49.640 the market what we can do right now is
00:44:51.760 we can fix it and here's the important
00:44:53.280 Point people will then argue oh what if
00:44:55.040 there's a down year or two down year in
00:44:56.319 a row you know what we're already going
00:44:58.920 to be printing money to make up the hole
00:45:00.880 in Social Security we're not going to
00:45:01.920 let Social Security go bankrupt we're
00:45:03.119 not going to let it dry out so we're
00:45:04.680 already going to print money to make the
00:45:06.319 Social Security whole so if that's the
00:45:08.559 case we can create a a back stop for
00:45:10.920 Social Security we're g to have to do it
00:45:12.359 either way but we might as
00:45:14.520 well we might as well take on the go
00:45:17.240 yeah no no no chth you were gonna say
00:45:19.000 something the reason why we didn't do it
00:45:21.359 goes back to what you said before which
00:45:22.720 is we have a bunch of we had a bunch of
00:45:25.400 very quote unquote well-educated ivy
00:45:28.200 league trained people running these
00:45:30.160 institutions and the feedback I don't
00:45:33.480 even know what it said but I can tell
00:45:34.800 you what the memo said there's too much
00:45:37.000 risk we've sensitized this model it
00:45:39.680 doesn't make sense this is the safest
00:45:41.480 thing to do so it goes back to just like
00:45:44.319 we need a little bit more practical
00:45:46.200 thinking like at the end of the day why
00:45:48.200 the S&P 500 exists is of all the
00:45:51.400 thousands and thousands and thousands of
00:45:53.240 companies in the world you know how many
00:45:54.359 companies in the world make more than a
00:45:56.520 billion a year more than
00:45:59.960 20,000 and of that 20,000 the S&P 500 is
00:46:04.119 just the 500 best it's the best of the
00:46:07.359 best of the best so to your point
00:46:08.839 freeberg it didn't take a PhD from
00:46:11.720 Harvard to figure out that if you just
00:46:13.200 owned an index of the absolute 500 best
00:46:16.800 things happening at any given point in
00:46:19.680 it would have gone up so since when do
00:46:21.920 America since when are Americans risk
00:46:24.559 intolerant like there's something baked
00:46:26.760 in into the DNA of the people that
00:46:29.200 decide to leave their families and move
00:46:31.079 here totally immigrant country and to
00:46:33.599 your point imagine logging in like like
00:46:35.359 we've all had I'm assuming a 401k
00:46:37.559 account and I remember how exciting it
00:46:39.040 is to log in and see the account and
00:46:41.280 Schult I want to say something that's
00:46:42.480 really important like you talk about us
00:46:44.040 people like you know earlier on the
00:46:45.599 commentary which is something I hear a
00:46:47.000 lot my first job was making $425 an hour
00:46:50.119 cleaning toilets in a pool hall in
00:46:52.160 Upstate New York jamath has similar
00:46:54.079 stories jcal has similar stories like
00:46:56.119 any of us that that 455 Canadian working
00:46:59.440 at Burger King yeah and I had like and
00:47:01.880 then well the worst part about my job in
00:47:03.559 the pool hall was that then the manager
00:47:04.880 made me go play poker at his house and
00:47:06.480 he took all the money back which I stole
00:47:08.280 I stole the chicken fingers at night
00:47:10.760 bring them home my mom would my mom
00:47:12.599 would whip him up but it was so exciting
00:47:14.880 in my career in my life to be able to
00:47:17.119 like go from that moment to the moment
00:47:19.359 where I had a 401k and I could log in I
00:47:21.400 could see the businesses that I owned
00:47:22.760 and I understood that and I saw the
00:47:24.079 value go up and I got to participate
00:47:25.839 that imagine if every American when when
00:47:27.839 you get your Social Security statement
00:47:29.359 today all it tells you is a dollar
00:47:31.000 amount and how much you're going to get
00:47:31.920 in the future imagine if you logged in
00:47:33.800 and you got to see all the businesses
00:47:35.079 you own a piece of and you got to
00:47:36.680 participate conect every single day be
00:47:38.800 lighting a Tesla we can fix this and by
00:47:41.040 the way we can solve both The Sovereign
00:47:42.559 wealth fund question and the Social
00:47:44.480 Security trust fund question every
00:47:46.280 dollar that's going into these Sovereign
00:47:48.160 wealth fund ideas or if they come to
00:47:49.880 fruition or in my opinion and obviously
00:47:51.960 I haven't spoken facts about this but
00:47:53.440 the crypto fund and all this other sort
00:47:54.839 of stuff every dollar that should go
00:47:56.359 into the social Social Security trust
00:47:57.599 fund and that Social Security trust fund
00:47:59.720 should be for the benefit of all
00:48:01.160 Americans and it should be equities it
00:48:03.079 should be ownership it should be
00:48:04.440 participation in what the American
00:48:07.000 dream the American dream enabled us all
00:48:09.599 to succeed and it should enable everyone
00:48:11.640 else to participate in shares and equity
00:48:13.800 in American Enterprise that can come to
00:48:15.359 Market so it's not about a thousand
00:48:16.960 bucks on your born it's about an ongoing
00:48:18.800 participation putting your money in and
00:48:20.520 having that money allocated in a way
00:48:22.520 that America that smart and Wealthy
00:48:24.440 Americans get to allocate it which is
00:48:26.119 into owning and businesses that's it
00:48:28.559 Shelty yeah go no I I think it's great I
00:48:31.240 hopefully you guys don't feel like I'm
00:48:32.520 Like discrediting You by saying you guys
00:48:34.599 but I'm just trying to give you guys I
00:48:35.960 think a great it's an important framing
00:48:37.760 because it's like it you're you're 100%
00:48:40.119 right but like I you know we see
00:48:41.599 comments on YouTube like oh you guys and
00:48:43.240 I'm like dude I remember like it feels
00:48:46.119 like yesterday when I was in fraking
00:48:48.520 debt I graduated college with a bunch of
00:48:50.240 debt and I went and like found a job and
00:48:52.359 worked my ass off and I was working 20
00:48:54.559 hour days and never slept and like you
00:48:56.559 know it wasn't easy I mean I feel like
00:48:58.440 very emotional about this right now
00:48:59.520 sorry hang
00:49:00.920 on
00:49:03.480 um listen it it wasn't easy bro it
00:49:07.359 wasn't given to you none of us inherited
00:49:09.480 none of us inherited we we we came to
00:49:11.319 America and to see the joy to to see
00:49:14.440 what we all benefited from I'm getting
00:49:15.960 emotional about this but it's like well
00:49:17.599 it's because the American dream's broken
00:49:20.559 we got to fix
00:49:21.920 it to have people talk about it as if as
00:49:24.559 if being successful and and getting
00:49:27.280 there is a crime it a bad person it's a
00:49:31.079 Dream It's a dream schy go I think the
00:49:33.440 the framing this is very important like
00:49:35.200 my mom is also an immigrant right she
00:49:37.240 came here from Scotland she has no
00:49:38.839 education I think she stopped going to
00:49:40.079 school at like 14 or something like that
00:49:41.920 comes to America and she's this massive
00:49:44.000 success here in terms of like where she
00:49:46.079 came from where she got to right and
00:49:47.920 what she was able to buy she was able to
00:49:49.319 buy a home in the East Village of New
00:49:51.599 York City she able to buy a beach house
00:49:53.799 like just off of like grind and hard
00:49:55.680 work yeah what she saw here which I'm
00:49:58.000 sure a lot of you guys also saw is
00:49:59.799 opportunity she had ambition and
00:50:02.520 opportunity and I I think that that's
00:50:05.960 what I think a lot of times that's what
00:50:07.720 immigrants see when they come here
00:50:09.319 because they probably come from places
00:50:10.799 where they feel absolutely no
00:50:12.160 opportunity so the second they feel like
00:50:14.000 there's a little of it if they work
00:50:15.400 those 20 hours a week I mean I saw my
00:50:16.960 parents grind totally like my work ethic
00:50:19.119 just comes from watching them you know
00:50:20.520 what I mean just watching them just kill
00:50:22.160 it every single day so what I think that
00:50:25.319 you guys are speaking to which is really
00:50:26.799 important and I think it's important
00:50:27.920 that people know your story as well
00:50:29.400 because it becomes more accessible when
00:50:31.160 they see you guys and they know what you
00:50:32.480 came from and they know you're working
00:50:33.559 at Burger King and now you guys are
00:50:35.079 worth billions of dollars it's very
00:50:37.040 important that Americans know that
00:50:38.240 that's possible for them maybe not to
00:50:39.559 hit a billion but maybe to hit a million
00:50:41.599 maybe hit 300,000 maybe to buy a house
00:50:45.440 that's $100,000 that they're really
00:50:47.720 proud of own it
00:50:49.480 outright and the fact that this is
00:50:51.720 accessible like what you just said to me
00:50:54.520 is just hope and abundance like that's
00:50:56.160 the message of what you just said you
00:50:57.680 said something that made it seem very
00:50:59.000 simple to me we put this money here
00:51:00.880 everybody's now invested in the success
00:51:02.680 of the American economy and now when we
00:51:04.599 see the Stock Market ticker look green
00:51:07.599 which is all the average person sees
00:51:09.319 green or red we don't really know
00:51:10.640 anything but when we see green we get
00:51:13.079 excited we
00:51:14.359 go and now we goes up and we start
00:51:17.119 rooting Jam feels that way too yeah but
00:51:20.119 think he's getting excited right now if
00:51:21.359 you're saying it he's gonna start crying
00:51:23.200 oh wait it's green today it's been red
00:51:25.640 for a week but think like CEOs right
00:51:27.960 like these people uh have become
00:51:30.400 villainized right and it's because we're
00:51:32.520 not attached to the success of their
00:51:34.280 companies that's right when if you if
00:51:36.359 your biggest holding is Tesla please
00:51:38.880 believe you're not upset yeah I think
00:51:41.119 people think that their success now
00:51:42.720 works against your best interests yes
00:51:45.119 instead of and the system's rigged and
00:51:47.079 the system's rigged and you can't be
00:51:48.599 part of it and you're being ground down
00:51:51.079 this is a I think really good proposal
00:51:53.000 freeberg and and if you look at housing
00:51:55.200 that's the other one I I when I if I run
00:51:57.359 for president you know what my position
00:51:58.640 is going to be Shela what's that I'm
00:52:00.280 going to build five cities with 3
00:52:02.440 million homes in each and you can only
00:52:04.960 buy them if you make under x amount per
00:52:06.920 year it's not going to be like the
00:52:08.000 projects or like you know subsidized
00:52:10.000 housing in New York talking about it's
00:52:12.280 not going to be sty town okay it's gonna
00:52:14.240 be nice house that's pretty good if you
00:52:16.079 can get it yeah St Town's not bad but
00:52:18.720 not like projects I'm talking about like
00:52:20.119 proper homes like bu we are the most
00:52:23.319 Innovative
00:52:24.520 country Society ever created created I
00:52:26.960 mean since the Greeks they were pretty
00:52:28.200 great too but we could build five new
00:52:29.799 cities why the can't we build five new
00:52:31.280 cities with 3 million homes in it let's
00:52:32.839 do some like Manhattan project for
00:52:34.680 housing and then healthare how the hell
00:52:36.480 do we not have like good healthare for
00:52:38.480 everybody in this country the richest
00:52:39.839 country in the world greatest economy
00:52:41.400 whatever we should be able to solve
00:52:43.079 those problems and that's why people
00:52:44.319 don't feel like they're part of this is
00:52:46.520 because basic housing basic health care
00:52:49.520 and your retirement it's not like it's
00:52:51.319 rigged against you this sounds crazy but
00:52:53.240 for young people I think they would
00:52:56.599 forgive healthare if they were invested
00:52:59.440 in the market and I think being invested
00:53:02.240 in the market is just so daunting but
00:53:04.240 the feeling that everybody else is
00:53:05.880 getting rich when you're not is the
00:53:07.359 reason why I bought crypto not knowing
00:53:10.160 anything about it it's a reason why
00:53:11.960 everybody else bought it it's this
00:53:13.440 feeling that the train is running away
00:53:15.760 and you're not going to be part of it so
00:53:17.680 how do we get them to feel part of that
00:53:19.799 success I think really importantly you
00:53:21.760 know today just just to give you guys
00:53:23.559 some other statistics 60% of middle
00:53:26.880 class households net worth is in their
00:53:28.640 home only 10 10% of their net worth is
00:53:31.400 in owning the S&P 500 in in index funds
00:53:34.240 or whatever in their retirement accounts
00:53:36.200 and so by creating this American Dream
00:53:38.240 around housing and allowing the federal
00:53:40.119 government to provide loans on housing
00:53:42.119 we've increased the cost of housing
00:53:43.559 we've created a very like destructive
00:53:45.400 housing bubble in the sense that it has
00:53:47.280 reduced people's exposure to
00:53:49.319 participation in productive value
00:53:51.440 creation and that's through the
00:53:52.839 ownership of businesses instead we've
00:53:55.040 stored our net worth in the house and in
00:53:57.599 order to keep the economy and the social
00:54:00.160 structure stable we've created policies
00:54:03.359 that allow the continuation of the
00:54:05.760 growth in the value of houses so people
00:54:07.480 feel like their net worth is
00:54:08.480 incrementing and 100% right and that's
00:54:10.760 unfortunately very making new housing
00:54:14.160 which makes it worse with the
00:54:15.359 restrictions have you guys heard of
00:54:16.920 Warren Buffett's most public failure no
00:54:20.400 Warren Buffett's most public failure was
00:54:22.319 when he was brought on as an adviser to
00:54:24.520 Arnold Schwarzenegger when schwarzen was
00:54:26.760 running for governor and Buffett kind of
00:54:30.760 looked at the laws in California and
00:54:34.240 there's a law in California when you own
00:54:35.880 a home that when you pass on you can
00:54:38.240 pass it off to your kids and you can
00:54:39.799 basically keep the cost that you paid in
00:54:43.200 terms of setting the real estate taxes
00:54:45.200 and it's had an enormously negative
00:54:47.799 effect in unlocking turnover of homes
00:54:51.720 and that's a large driver of why homes
00:54:54.160 are so expensive in California so
00:54:55.559 Buffett looked at this
00:54:57.599 and there was a lot of fanfare
00:54:59.040 Schwarzenegger is like here's my
00:55:00.559 economic genius and first thing he said
00:55:02.720 was guys I think we should repeal this
00:55:04.160 law he was gone two days later wow he's
00:55:07.160 not popular and by the way there's a lot
00:55:08.960 of other policies like this you know two
00:55:11.319 days later he had to resign if you do
00:55:13.079 the if you do the true kind of like
00:55:14.720 macroanalysis as an investor you should
00:55:17.160 probably have about 20% of your net
00:55:18.760 worth in the US in real estate not 60%
00:55:22.119 and so we need to give people the
00:55:23.960 ability and we need to think about all
00:55:25.599 the follow on trickle effects of
00:55:27.720 creating a set of laws a set of policies
00:55:30.599 that basically incentivize almost all of
00:55:32.359 your net worth to go into a single asset
00:55:34.319 your home and what that then means in
00:55:36.200 the fact that we have to keep pumping up
00:55:37.400 the value of that home and we have to
00:55:39.160 have a system in order for people to
00:55:40.480 feel like they're getting ahead keep
00:55:42.079 inflating and eventually people can't
00:55:43.319 afford homes and that's where we are
00:55:44.520 today when did you guys first started
00:55:46.680 start your education in in the markets
00:55:49.480 like at what age did you feel like you
00:55:53.119 sought out I bought my first stock in
00:55:56.640 the company I was working for or the
00:55:59.319 parent company the company I was working
00:56:00.520 for in 1989 when I was 18 years old so
00:56:03.039 18 what about you did I bought $300 in
00:56:05.319 stock um I signed up for an E Trade
00:56:08.000 account in college uh because I saw that
00:56:11.000 TV show called bull do you remember that
00:56:13.119 TV show was about Investment Banking
00:56:14.599 during the.com bubble it was such a no
00:56:16.359 one knows that show and I was like man
00:56:18.160 Wall Street is so cool I want to learn
00:56:20.400 about stocks because I was an
00:56:21.480 astrophysics major I didn't like I
00:56:23.240 didn't know what I was going to do after
00:56:24.520 I was going to go to graduate school or
00:56:25.920 whatever
00:56:26.760 and then I got caught up in the.com
00:56:28.440 bubble and I started reading the Wall
00:56:29.760 Street Journal every day I would take it
00:56:31.160 down to the freaking Plaza and I would
00:56:32.960 read the journal at school during lunch
00:56:35.400 and I tried to learn about tech and
00:56:36.960 business and markets because i' always
00:56:37.960 been a tech guy and I'm like man there's
00:56:39.480 all these startups and this is how the
00:56:40.680 markets work so I set up an E Trade
00:56:42.280 account I put some money in it and I
00:56:43.960 started and I bought some stocks and I
00:56:45.599 read the investor business business
00:56:47.280 daily on what stocks to buy they had a
00:56:49.680 rating and I bought those stocks and
00:56:51.520 they went up and I'm like man this is
00:56:53.039 awesome like I love owning stocks and
00:56:55.240 that kind of kicked me off and then got
00:56:56.400 an investment banking job after college
00:56:58.119 and it totally changed my career
00:56:59.559 trajectory I was like I want to go work
00:57:01.280 in the tech industry and work in
00:57:02.400 business what about you and it shifted
00:57:03.880 up for me you buy your first Equity but
00:57:06.000 by the way that I sorry let me just say
00:57:07.440 one thing what you asked is a really
00:57:08.880 important question I just realized this
00:57:10.280 Andrew because my um my interest in that
00:57:13.039 stock market thing at that time actually
00:57:15.440 changed my career trajectory and it
00:57:17.240 really reset what I was going to do with
00:57:18.760 my life to get involved in business and
00:57:21.160 go work in the tech industry as opposed
00:57:22.960 to work in science as a researcher and
00:57:25.520 that was a really shift for me so it it
00:57:27.400 gave me that kind of feeling of like oh
00:57:29.280 I got to learn more and then that that
00:57:30.599 kind of changed my career sorry go ahead
00:57:32.319 Jam I was 14 or 15 years old and there
00:57:35.559 was a this is when Rodney King had the
00:57:39.000 kicked out of him and almost
00:57:40.720 died all these race riots in LA and
00:57:44.960 nothing had changed actually in America
00:57:46.799 but where I was growing up in Canada the
00:57:49.480 provincial government created a program
00:57:51.240 that said if you're a minority and
00:57:52.760 you're on welfare we'll pay for you to
00:57:55.359 get a job
00:57:56.839 I I was a minority on welfare so I got a
00:58:00.680 job and it was at a startup that was
00:58:03.559 just going parabolic and their stock was
00:58:06.559 going nuclear and I lived in this shitty
00:58:09.760 part of
00:58:10.720 town and I would see the controller of
00:58:13.359 that company drive past me every day
00:58:16.160 while I was waiting for the bus and one
00:58:18.520 day he stopped and I went with this guy
00:58:21.160 Sam leg he drove me that whole
00:58:23.480 summer and he taught me what does the
00:58:26.880 company do why is the founder a
00:58:28.799 billionaire what the hell does this even
00:58:30.559 mean he unpacked it and so I saw
00:58:33.400 firsthand what it meant to work not for
00:58:35.839 a salary but to get a stake in the thing
00:58:38.880 that you're working for I bought a
00:58:40.640 couple shares it went up and it was
00:58:44.079 great but then I really fell in love
00:58:46.200 with this idea that I could understand
00:58:47.960 something and own a piece of it and then
00:58:50.480 it really accelerated when I graduated
00:58:52.440 from college because I was like freeberg
00:58:54.440 I was in debt and I was like how the do
00:58:56.200 get out of debt and I traded stocks on
00:58:59.640 behalf of my boss this guy Mike fer who
00:59:02.760 I thank to this day and I made so much
00:59:05.359 money right before the do crash he gave
00:59:08.400 me the money to pay off my student loans
00:59:10.839 wow wow and then ever since then I was
00:59:13.240 hooked I was like okay I can learn this
00:59:15.559 and I can deal with the vicissitudes of
00:59:17.839 this look the markets are brutal there
00:59:19.680 are moments where you just wake up and
00:59:21.599 it looks like everything's working and
00:59:22.880 then there are moments and this is what
00:59:24.880 everybody needs to understand though if
00:59:26.680 some of these programs work where it
00:59:29.319 literally looks like the bottom is
00:59:30.720 falling out and I cannot describe to
00:59:32.880 people the pressure you will feel on
00:59:35.480 behalf of you and your family when it
00:59:37.599 looks like you're taking a 30 or 40 or
00:59:41.160 50% negative downturn to your net worth
00:59:44.359 yeah it inflicts a level of
00:59:47.240 psychological damage that I cannot
00:59:49.680 describe to you and the the bigger the
00:59:51.559 numbers get by the way I told this story
00:59:54.000 on Tucker there was a period where I
00:59:55.880 would would wake up and I could just
00:59:56.960 tweet and the markets would go up they
00:59:58.640 were like what's he going to say next
01:00:00.559 and then it all stopped and then there
01:00:02.599 was a two and a half year period where I
01:00:04.720 gave it all back and then some wow
01:00:07.640 that's frustrating yeah the mest Touch
01:00:09.319 goes away it's beyond frustrating it
01:00:12.000 shakes you to your core so if we do
01:00:14.240 these programs I think the freedberg
01:00:15.680 idea is is just beautiful it's lovely
01:00:18.640 what about you sh when did you make but
01:00:20.559 I just to finish if we do it we have to
01:00:23.680 try to teach people how to deal with the
01:00:25.640 draw Downs because that's where if you
01:00:28.119 don't teach them how to deal with the
01:00:30.559 the volatility of losing money it's
01:00:32.960 great when everything's green but those
01:00:35.400 red days man how you comport yourself
01:00:38.520 how you act how you treat other people
01:00:40.960 in the red days are the only days that
01:00:43.240 matter yeah it's a Growing Experience
01:00:45.079 what about you Shelty when did you buy
01:00:46.160 your first Equity I was
01:00:48.559 probably
01:00:50.400 35
01:00:52.599 ohine so my my I mean my parent how old
01:00:55.680 are you I'm 41 so I maybe even a little
01:00:58.720 bit later now I might have like owned
01:01:00.319 stock without even realizing it type of
01:01:02.240 thing where like I had like a business
01:01:03.799 manager who set up some retirement fund
01:01:05.680 or something like that but not me
01:01:07.039 actively choosing a stock and buying it
01:01:09.920 um my w my wife's father-in-law is a
01:01:14.559 very uh successful businessman and uh
01:01:17.280 he's he's he's I I don't want to say
01:01:19.559 like predicted the markets really well
01:01:21.319 but he has he was in Nvidia like super
01:01:23.640 early early early early and uh a bunch
01:01:26.440 of others and we were like sitting down
01:01:28.640 and like aspin somewhere and he like
01:01:30.480 said Hey listen what do you mean you
01:01:31.559 don't own anything he goes hey can you
01:01:33.440 take a you know I don't know if he said
01:01:35.319 10 grand or 100 Grand or something like
01:01:36.720 that he goes can you just put it in
01:01:38.119 these different stocks I go okay sure I
01:01:39.960 open up this like E Trade account or
01:01:41.319 whatever the it was but an interesting
01:01:44.359 thing right there is like you guys were
01:01:45.480 so young was 18 22 14 and to me I think
01:01:50.839 like the education of this is really
01:01:52.440 important like my parents did really
01:01:54.319 well but they're financially
01:01:56.359 like there was no passing on this like
01:01:58.440 knowledge of like investing when what it
01:02:00.839 means to invest like they made their
01:02:02.760 money by like working every single day
01:02:04.319 for it not like you guys don't but like
01:02:05.799 they were teaching dance lessons so it's
01:02:07.279 like this is how much the dance lesson
01:02:08.559 costs and you pay me and maybe I'll have
01:02:10.839 40 people in the class okay more people
01:02:12.359 are paying and now other teachers can
01:02:14.400 also teach but it was intimidating to
01:02:17.079 them it was int intimidating to me it
01:02:19.440 still is intimidating to me well this is
01:02:21.119 the I think the upside of crypto in some
01:02:23.000 ways also the upside of prize picks or
01:02:25.640 the you know gambling poker it's the
01:02:27.760 upside of Robin Hood and and coinbase
01:02:30.000 and all these things being available
01:02:31.319 this generation generation bet like they
01:02:33.559 love to gamble these young kids this is
01:02:35.200 my concern they're no but they're
01:02:36.920 learning they're learning how to take
01:02:38.760 the the downdrafts I Lear I think they
01:02:41.680 are learning so maybe like the barrier
01:02:43.039 of Entry is less but my concern is that
01:02:45.119 they're treating it more like gambling
01:02:46.920 than investing and I think that we've
01:02:49.400 almost like tricked the American public
01:02:51.599 into thinking that investing is gambling
01:02:54.559 when the way that you guys are
01:02:55.880 describing is it's not it's like
01:02:57.319 investing in the S&P and then leaving it
01:02:59.359 there and taking those downturns and
01:03:01.200 waiting for it to come back up yeah but
01:03:03.000 here's the thing you have to learn these
01:03:04.400 lessons at the poker table you cannot
01:03:06.160 play poker without real money or else
01:03:08.119 you're not going to get the burn you're
01:03:09.200 not going to stay up at night how do we
01:03:10.680 how do we so that's what these kids are
01:03:12.119 doing they're how do we educate them
01:03:13.559 it's not every kid right it's the
01:03:15.319 education comes from doing and if you
01:03:17.240 let these kids trade they will figure it
01:03:19.599 out over time and then what happens is
01:03:20.960 like you they get married they get they
01:03:23.039 get a baby they want to get a house and
01:03:24.680 then they say you know what I I'm going
01:03:25.960 to I'm going to stop buying meme coins
01:03:27.680 I'm going to start buying Bitcoin I'm
01:03:28.920 going to stop buying Bitcoin I'm going
01:03:30.440 to buy Nvidia and things with real R
01:03:32.799 they just get addicted to get happen all
01:03:34.359 the time exactly I agree with I agree
01:03:36.319 with SCH I don't think that I I think
01:03:38.119 you're being super reductive like oh
01:03:39.559 they'll get on the the all of a sudden
01:03:42.119 understand Dave Swenson's Yale endowment
01:03:44.760 asset allocation model [ __ ] I've
01:03:46.720 seen they won't I have seen thousands
01:03:49.200 and thousands and thousands of guys over
01:03:51.880 time who deeply steeped in this business
01:03:55.279 wash out
01:03:56.720 yeah and each to a one the more
01:04:00.039 sophisticated they get they all fall to
01:04:02.319 the same pressures which is they don't
01:04:04.079 know how to simplify and they don't know
01:04:07.160 how to be patient these are things that
01:04:09.319 every human being needs to learn and I
01:04:12.440 don't think time in the market actually
01:04:14.720 solves those two traits those are
01:04:16.640 psychological traits that you have to go
01:04:19.039 and figure out in a different way you
01:04:20.640 look inside yourself and you have to
01:04:22.960 figure those out okay yeah fair enough
01:04:25.359 but but between the choice of hey we're
01:04:27.359 going to grow up blue collar we have no
01:04:29.400 access to these markets we have no way
01:04:31.160 to trade in them we have no way to learn
01:04:33.599 and then today I think the system we
01:04:35.520 have today is better can people go off
01:04:38.240 the you know jump the fence and lose all
01:04:40.520 their money of course they can but they
01:04:42.119 could go to Vegas and do that prior to
01:04:43.799 that they could work with a bookie they
01:04:45.160 could do football sheets I I think
01:04:46.799 they're learning and when you use some
01:04:48.279 of these modern apps and you look at the
01:04:50.160 strategies and you see people on Reddit
01:04:52.599 working on these stocks and their thesis
01:04:54.680 I think it's trending the right there
01:04:56.039 can always be more education but this
01:04:58.279 is don't bet on the Jets right you said
01:05:00.640 it before I americ doesn't even know
01:05:03.039 what compound interest is I agree with
01:05:05.400 you in fact I'll tell you I'll tell you
01:05:06.839 a great story work to do I one of the
01:05:09.279 best things that happened when I
01:05:11.400 invested in the Golden State Warriors I
01:05:13.240 bought 10% of the team in 2011 or
01:05:16.079 something I got to meet all of them and
01:05:18.160 I got to meet a lot of my heroes and I
01:05:20.839 remember one meeting where I sat
01:05:23.359 with a go like play let's just put it
01:05:26.359 that we'll bleep it out we'll bleep it
01:05:27.599 out no I don't want to say his name but
01:05:30.400 okay fair
01:05:32.240 enough and he asked me the most
01:05:35.920 incredible question he's like jat can
01:05:38.319 you explain compound interest and Schulz
01:05:41.599 I can tell you I still have this
01:05:44.240 spreadsheet I just showed him a compound
01:05:46.760 interest
01:05:48.480 table and he had no idea how 8% versus
01:05:53.319 10% is like gargantuan over 50 years
01:05:56.480 over 20 years yeah and to your point it
01:05:59.760 was Illuminating that you're right
01:06:02.079 unless you unless you go and you jump
01:06:04.039 into it and you live it and Jason I
01:06:06.480 agree with you like there's nothing like
01:06:08.799 look Stan dram Miller says the same
01:06:10.240 thing invest then investigate like
01:06:12.200 there's nothing like putting the risk on
01:06:13.920 okay there's nothing like playing a hand
01:06:15.720 in poker there's nothing like taking a
01:06:17.799 shot at a different strategy in
01:06:19.200 blackjack win or lose you get feedback
01:06:22.000 but my point is most people don't get
01:06:24.319 better and so that's what you have to
01:06:26.559 solve is like how can you make it
01:06:28.319 interesting fun how can you talk about
01:06:30.400 the losses like this is a thing that I
01:06:31.960 had immense trouble with I still do
01:06:33.839 today I think I've gotten better with it
01:06:35.760 is to be able to talk about the losses
01:06:37.799 how do you talk about getting whacked
01:06:38.960 for $4 billion I can do it now but it's
01:06:41.440 brutal yeah it stung for a while for you
01:06:45.039 you saw you're a better person since you
01:06:46.799 saw me go through it how ashamed was I
01:06:49.559 for the two years that I had to unwind
01:06:51.240 that how bad it was hard for you yeah
01:06:53.680 yeah yeah it was hard I mean you're
01:06:54.839 imagine your whole identity is built
01:06:56.440 into you know you being successful in
01:06:59.119 these markets and you measure it the
01:07:01.119 wrong way like you point to the number
01:07:02.440 in the bank account not the way your
01:07:03.880 wife treats you not the way your kids
01:07:05.960 treat you not the way your friends treat
01:07:07.240 you and then you're like okay well I'm
01:07:10.279 30 40 50 60 70 80% poor so I'm just that
01:07:13.359 much less of a human being yeah but
01:07:16.200 that's a good reality check to lean into
01:07:18.400 family and those things that matter so
01:07:19.799 my point is like if you can if we can
01:07:21.520 get people more into the market I think
01:07:23.240 it's an incredible thing but you have to
01:07:25.520 to wrap it in these guard rils that have
01:07:27.400 nothing to do with the market they
01:07:29.440 everything to do with who you are as a
01:07:30.839 person and I think like the first step
01:07:33.480 is showing like what is the most
01:07:36.119 simplistic version of the benefit of the
01:07:39.359 market and I think it's compound
01:07:40.680 interest I I really think that that is
01:07:42.720 if we start there like remove the stock
01:07:44.640 market don't even talk about it just
01:07:46.000 like what happens if I left it in a
01:07:47.839 savings account that's getting 4% and I
01:07:49.920 don't touch it right now you know the
01:07:51.279 rule of 72 that was the one that opened
01:07:53.520 my brain up so the rule of 72 is
01:07:55.480 whatever the percentage you grow uh per
01:07:58.760 month divide it into 72 so let's say you
01:08:01.279 were growing 7.2% in the market per year
01:08:04.319 divide that it takes 10 years to double
01:08:07.119 your money so it's a time to double your
01:08:08.520 money okay if you were growing 7% a
01:08:11.880 month you know on whatever your
01:08:13.799 Investments are let's say you got a
01:08:15.119 great business that's growing like
01:08:16.560 Facebook or something like that that
01:08:17.880 means you double the number of users or
01:08:19.359 Revenue every 7.2 months once you
01:08:21.880 understand that you can do it quickly
01:08:23.439 just like in poker you know the number
01:08:24.799 of outs each card represents roughly 2%
01:08:28.040 chance because there's 50 of them right
01:08:29.520 so they each count for about 2% then you
01:08:32.120 can start doing this stuff in the back
01:08:33.319 of your head I I I had this idea I think
01:08:35.198 I talked about it here on the program of
01:08:36.479 doing a kids investment club and I
01:08:37.920 bought the domain kids investment Club I
01:08:40.120 actually need to do this I got to
01:08:42.359 prioritize this and find a CEO for it or
01:08:44.479 do it as a nonprofit or something just
01:08:46.359 kids need to learn this early Robin Hood
01:08:49.238 or somebody should make an app where
01:08:50.600 they can invest like a shadow but it's
01:08:52.920 you know like with their parents maybe
01:08:54.319 they can make the trade the par approves
01:08:56.000 it something like that there's something
01:08:58.080 where we should be learning all this in
01:08:59.399 high school this should be like this
01:09:01.600 what's more important than this remove
01:09:03.279 the fear remove the fear and and the
01:09:06.080 reason it's important is what we were
01:09:07.279 saying earlier get the American people
01:09:09.399 invested in American success and you
01:09:11.799 will find so much more patriotism you
01:09:14.359 will not find us nitpicking on all these
01:09:16.279 little things that a lot of us maybe go
01:09:18.679 why is this such a big deal like the
01:09:21.319 bathroom like most of us aren't
01:09:22.640 unaffected I cannot begin to explain how
01:09:25.120 quick will forget about the bathrooms
01:09:27.120 when the S&P is up 15% and you're
01:09:30.198 looking at your portfolio and you're
01:09:31.880 like I you could take a sh wherever you
01:09:34.158 want okay absolutely yes I have you got
01:09:37.520 something else to focus on absolutely
01:09:39.439 look at this hey fredberg here's your
01:09:41.799 time machine check it out there's your
01:09:43.359 favorite show I don't want to make you
01:09:44.799 more emotional but there he is your guy
01:09:47.319 Stanley Tucci from bull I think it only
01:09:49.679 made I think it only made it one season
01:09:51.759 one season but Tucci gang in full effect
01:09:54.440 I was such a tech ner growing up but I
01:09:56.159 never thought about the business of
01:09:57.360 technology and then the startup boom
01:09:58.800 happened and you got this bull show on
01:10:01.159 TV and I'm like man this is so much more
01:10:02.920 exciting than sitting in a freaking lab
01:10:04.719 doing mathematical modeling where I was
01:10:06.880 like pulling my freaking hair out I'm
01:10:08.239 like I want to get after that yeah and
01:10:10.520 the rest is history you know have you
01:10:12.159 guys watched Stanley Tucci on HBO where
01:10:14.080 he tours Italy and he does his little so
01:10:16.239 great and on SE seen it and I've seen
01:10:19.600 cook on Tik Tok he's like today is it
01:10:21.880 rolling it's rolling today I'm going to
01:10:24.920 make you FR it's got but I'm doing it in
01:10:28.440 the capacho base and we're going to put
01:10:31.640 and I'm like I just can this guy do ASMR
01:10:34.880 or put me to bed at night the best I I
01:10:38.400 got a man crush on Tucci tui's the best
01:10:40.960 I mean he's I would like to roll with
01:10:43.000 tuchi can you imagine if we went to
01:10:44.560 Italy and just had like a just roll with
01:10:47.040 Tui through
01:10:48.280 Italy I love that guy any dream is
01:10:51.320 possible J you could pull it I know
01:10:53.199 we're all dreaming here we're all
01:10:54.400 dreaming here
01:10:55.840 all right we're still dreamers by the
01:10:57.199 way really important everyone should
01:10:59.600 know that I think like there's no the
01:11:01.600 thing that the thing that a lot of
01:11:02.679 people assume this is the true about
01:11:05.040 humans in general is there's an end to
01:11:06.360 the rainbow but there isn't you ride the
01:11:08.400 rainbow till you die that's it and
01:11:11.040 there's always hope there's always
01:11:12.199 dreams there's always more and it
01:11:14.360 doesn't stop that's what makes it fun
01:11:16.239 are you taking the ketamine in Austin or
01:11:18.000 something what happened you just got all
01:11:19.120 full I'm a little hung over today I

01:11:22.360 went to um we went to the Mothership
01:11:24.280 last night and we well we hung out with
01:11:27.440 a couple of your boys I think who you
01:11:29.679 hang out with Tony
01:11:32.159 Tony ton was very nice and um met Shane
01:11:35.880 Gillis was there Shane Shane Gillis was
01:11:37.800 there but he was big time he was big
01:11:39.280 time there was a mob around and we

01:11:42.760 take I didn't recogniz yeah he had a
01:11:45.440 shirt on so I didn't recognize he was
01:11:47.760 course yeah I was like but then I saw
01:11:49.280 the body shape and I was like yeah
01:11:50.679 that's that's probably probably him when
01:11:53.320 did you start in comedy I was uh I think
01:11:55.760 it's almost been like 18 years or
01:11:57.400 something like that so you started in
01:11:58.960 your early 20s in New York going to the
01:12:00.639 funny bone or what I have a question
01:12:02.360 actually how did you get into it how do
01:12:04.120 you keep your like how do you pay for
01:12:06.320 your life before you make it how like
01:12:08.880 what like is it that you have a normal
01:12:10.639 day job I lived I lived with my parents
01:12:13.080 for like a very long time like my
01:12:15.040 parents lived in the East Village so I
01:12:16.400 was walking distance from like multiple
01:12:18.320 comedy clubs it was you know incredibly
01:12:20.600 uh I mean I worked like with my parents
01:12:22.679 for a little bit then I managed
01:12:24.080 restaurants and like just managed them
01:12:26.080 you manag restaurants in Manhattan yeah
01:12:27.679 I did I started in Santa Barbara when I
01:12:29.199 was going to college that's where I did
01:12:31.000 my first comedy gig and then I manage a
01:12:33.440 restaurant out in Brooklyn and um not
01:12:37.360 called biscuit barbecue was in Park
01:12:39.280 Slope Brooklyn and then um then I
01:12:42.080 started to make a little money in
01:12:43.679 standup and it was like enough to like
01:12:45.080 buy a m Moon's Falafel I like had like a
01:12:47.960 five to FF money I had I had A5 to $10 a
01:12:51.199 day budget and I like I could eat cereal
01:12:53.480 for breakfast and then I just and I
01:12:55.880 saved some money cuz I was going to
01:12:57.400 school was when I was going to school I
01:12:59.199 was working at that restaurant and I
01:13:00.400 like saved some money and like I had a
01:13:01.880 little pipe dream Ving up a bar with a
01:13:03.600 friend of mine in New York and then I
01:13:05.440 was like you know what I'm just GNA
01:13:06.600 spend this money trying to be a comedian
01:13:09.120 and I hope by the time I get rid of the
01:13:12.520 money I'm making money a comedy and it
01:13:14.320 came down to like $700 in my bank
01:13:16.159 account I was like renting out the room
01:13:17.480 where I slept in and I would sleep in a
01:13:19.199 closet in my apartment and uh it just
01:13:23.080 and it worked out it just worked out I
01:13:25.120 started making a couple money do a
01:13:26.360 couple gigs started touring got on a TV
01:13:28.679 show and then it then it kind of worked
01:13:30.840 out was there a moment that where
01:13:33.600 because when you when you know when the
01:13:34.800 cancel culture was alive and well that's
01:13:36.960 when I first encountered you it was
01:13:38.520 initially on Tik Tok actually sure and
01:13:41.159 you were on fire because you were saying
01:13:42.920 stuff nobody else was saying and I
01:13:44.480 thought how does he even dare to pull
01:13:46.280 this [ __ ] off and was was there moment
01:13:49.400 that where you broke or you tipped or no
01:13:51.199 so I you kind of like it's interesting
01:13:53.120 you kind of break and then you go away
01:13:54.800 like so I so I broke on like some MTV
01:13:57.080 shows and I was you know doing all these
01:13:58.880 things on MTV had my own shows and all
01:14:00.639 that kind of stuff and then I kind of
01:14:03.080 you know the MTV thing kind of dried up
01:14:04.520 and then I kind of went away but I was
01:14:05.719 luckily doing this podcast with
01:14:07.040 Charlamagne and the podcast was very
01:14:08.760 popular and that was like providing for
01:14:10.239 me and then I was doing some shows on
01:14:12.679 the road and you know people would come
01:14:14.239 out from the podcast but um and then I
01:14:17.560 really couldn't get any traction in
01:14:18.840 standup world so when I was doing like
01:14:20.480 comedy stuff with MTV it wasn't really
01:14:23.159 in the standup world and it's because my
01:14:24.280 standup maybe wasn't of the ilk of what
01:14:27.159 was like popular at the time and I have
01:14:30.000 a lot of empathy by the way for like the
01:14:31.520 people who are just working at a network
01:14:33.719 they're producing these shows like they
01:14:35.239 their kids in private school I want to
01:14:37.320 tell a crazy joke about women or gays or
01:14:40.520 whatever the it is and they're like I'm
01:14:42.679 not trying to get fired and like I'm
01:14:44.440 just trying my kids in private school we
01:14:45.920 just got them into Dalton I don't want
01:14:47.320 to rock the boat like you know reason
01:14:50.280 you understand like I don't think that
01:14:51.719 they're self-preservation exct but I
01:14:54.600 didn't want to changed my comedy so I
01:14:56.440 was like okay where can I put it out and
01:15:00.199 luckily we were putting the podcast out
01:15:01.440 on YouTube it was successful and I just
01:15:03.239 started putting things out on YouTube
01:15:05.280 and I started doing these shows and
01:15:07.600 these shows started selling out it was
01:15:08.920 like really weird like the first thing I
01:15:11.000 put out I sold out the next weekend and
01:15:12.719 I was never gu sold out how many seats
01:15:14.480 where these are like 300 seat clubs and
01:15:16.480 you do maybe four or five shows a
01:15:17.920 weekend and you get 50 bucks a seat 20
01:15:20.400 bucks a seat no not even you get a flat
01:15:22.320 rate you get two grand to do the weekend
01:15:23.920 or something like that and a lot of
01:15:25.280 these times the comedy clubs would just
01:15:27.159 like call people and say hey do you want
01:15:28.679 to see this guy and give away the
01:15:29.719 tickets for free it was really the old
01:15:31.600 model was basically it's like a bar so
01:15:33.360 you just get the people in and they sell
01:15:34.719 the drinks so the weekend would sell out
01:15:37.159 then another one would sell out and I
01:15:38.320 was like holy maybe maybe there's
01:15:39.800 something there's a conversion rate that
01:15:41.840 I didn't see and I kept putting stuff
01:15:43.960 out on YouTube I would do a new clip
01:15:45.520 every week for a year on YouTube then I
01:15:47.320 put these a special on YouTube instead
01:15:50.000 and then I learned very quickly that
01:15:51.639 there was this huge like white space in
01:15:53.320 the market like the comedy on TV was
01:15:55.400 corny and people didn't really like it
01:15:57.719 and nobody was putting out like the
01:15:59.880 quote unquote like real comedy there's
01:16:01.960 different versions of Comedy but I'm
01:16:03.280 being very
01:16:04.199 simplistic and the more edgy stuff I put
01:16:06.880 on YouTube and it just exploded and um
01:16:10.320 yeah my career kind of really took off
01:16:11.639 from there and then covid came around
01:16:13.639 and there was a I was able to be a
01:16:16.199 little bit more honest because I wasn't
01:16:19.560 tied to a network and worried about
01:16:22.239 maybe losing my job at the network yeah
01:16:25.320 and then it just I think in America we
01:16:27.639 reward bravery yeah you just signed a
01:16:29.639 Netflix deal right I mean you did this
01:16:31.520 the show yeah we're actually doing the
01:16:34.080 show in Austin tonight where we're going
01:16:35.679 to talk with some folks about this
01:16:37.239 General concept where you start out as
01:16:38.840 kind of an independent yeah say whatever
01:16:40.639 you want you're totally free it's your
01:16:42.320 own platform it's your own voice yeah
01:16:44.639 and then you go sign a deal with another
01:16:46.360 platform like are you now you know did
01:16:48.560 you find it hard to trade the money for
01:16:51.159 whatever might come along with that
01:16:52.560 there's restrictions there's you there's
01:16:54.400 two way two ways to look at it right
01:16:55.840 it's like there's one like I think that
01:16:59.280 I don't want to give myself too much
01:17:00.520 credit here there but like I think that
01:17:02.199 what we've did is created another
01:17:03.840 Marketplace for comedy that the
01:17:05.480 streaming networks had to now compete
01:17:07.280 with yeah so they were losing Comics to
01:17:10.280 YouTube because it was more advantageous
01:17:12.920 to put your comedy up on YouTube and
01:17:14.360 build a following and then go sell
01:17:16.040 tickets on the road whereas before the
01:17:17.880 only way you could like really make a
01:17:19.159 big chunk of money on your comes if you
01:17:20.520 got one of these fancy specials now
01:17:22.639 people are like I don't even want to do
01:17:24.000 the special because if I put on YouTube
01:17:25.880 I can tour for years and really build a
01:17:27.600 fan base so to have this autonomy the
01:17:30.239 Netflix thing is interesting because
01:17:31.600 like Netflix is the second biggest I
01:17:33.920 guess uh streaming service on the planet
01:17:36.199 it's like YouTube than Netflix so if I
01:17:38.159 already have this huge imprint on
01:17:39.719 YouTube it would only be smart for me to
01:17:43.000 now tap into the second biggest and see
01:17:44.760 if there's some people there that aren't
01:17:45.960 consuming my content on YouTube so back
01:17:47.560 to the so then back to the the guy who's
01:17:49.800 got the the kid at Dalton now when you
01:17:52.120 go and negotiate a deal with Netflix are
01:17:54.520 they basically silent or do they not a
01:17:57.120 single note yeah so you do whatever you
01:17:59.199 want and it is what it is let it rip now
01:18:01.520 my last special was supposed to be with
01:18:03.639 Amazon so it was with Amazon and they
01:18:05.440 had some notes and I bought it back from
01:18:07.480 them and I put it out myself wow really
01:18:09.400 wow yeah and I sold it I sold it myself
01:18:11.560 and it actually one of the coolest
01:18:12.840 things ever because I think I'm may be
01:18:14.880 one of the only Comics that actually
01:18:16.239 knows what they're worth yeah you don't
01:18:19.239 really know what you're well walk us
01:18:21.199 through that so you do it and what do
01:18:22.840 the notes say that like
01:18:25.360 yeah it was two jokes and like I get it
01:18:26.800 they make money selling toilet paper
01:18:28.239 like why are they gonna have this huge
01:18:30.840 you know uh you made fun of the toilet
01:18:33.600 paper industry I got
01:18:35.440 it toilet paper Big T very powerful
01:18:38.560 Lobby you know what's funny is like
01:18:39.719 culture has changed and I feel like a
01:18:41.480 lot of times the streamers are like down
01:18:43.239 river from culture so like I bet now I
01:18:45.199 would be able to put it out on Amazon
01:18:46.560 and be totally fine but at that time it
01:18:48.320 was maybe very edgy and a volatile time
01:18:50.639 culturally so I was able to put it out
01:18:53.639 and you know I but you had the choice
01:18:55.679 right you could have taken the jokes out
01:18:57.080 and kept it but then instead you took
01:18:59.000 the harder path which is I'm just going
01:19:00.360 to buy it back yeah and I take the risk
01:19:02.639 and I'll figure it out later yeah I I've
01:19:05.000 I'm not risk averse at all I actually
01:19:07.040 enjoy risk it kind of excites me but um
01:19:10.080 what excites me more is like putting out
01:19:11.480 the piece exactly how I wanted to put it
01:19:13.199 out and I can't like scream about
01:19:15.040 censorship and comedians should do the
01:19:17.239 jokes we want to do and then the second
01:19:18.760 somebody gives me a big check I go whoa
01:19:20.760 we don't have to do the like I have to
01:19:22.639 be at least consistent on that and um
01:19:26.480 culture continued to change and you got
01:19:28.040 to give Netflix credit too like they
01:19:29.360 took a lot of they took a lot of hits
01:19:31.320 for putting out comedy that some people
01:19:33.320 thought was maybe a little bit too
01:19:34.560 offensive the Chappelle stuff Chelle
01:19:36.719 stuff really that put him in the
01:19:38.239 crosshairs exact they stood strong right
01:19:41.000 absolutely they stood strong and like
01:19:42.320 seeing that gave me a lot of confidence
01:19:44.520 I was like okay like and they literally
01:19:47.120 we just made the whole thing and they
01:19:48.920 just gave us money so like they were not
01:19:51.480 involved at all in like the creation so
01:19:54.280 to say
01:19:55.199 they they're involved in giving us money
01:19:56.880 for it and then they're involved in the
01:19:58.480 marketing obviously and their algorithm
01:20:01.280 and getting it that's all Sandos he's he
01:20:03.280 believes in comedy yeah but he's like a
01:20:05.360 huge comedy fan from back in the day I
01:20:07.280 think people don't realize that about
01:20:08.360 him like you need somebody who actually
01:20:10.679 loves the art and is not just looking at
01:20:12.840 it as a thing that they can monetize
01:20:14.960 like there's a the term this guy used
01:20:16.679 that you have to find somebody
01:20:17.880 spiritually aligned with you and that's
01:20:19.800 not mumbo jumbo it like they truly
01:20:22.239 understand the intention of Comedy so
01:20:24.120 things aren't hurtful or painful to them
01:20:26.400 because they understand what you intend
01:20:27.760 to do so and then I got interesting too
01:20:30.960 they they tried to cancel you what what
01:20:32.920 was the joke who the the mobs because
01:20:35.280 they went after Tony Hinchcliffe twice
01:20:37.840 oh yeah and each time he went 10x they
01:20:39.800 came after chamath on this program that
01:20:41.760 was the first level up we got three
01:20:43.120 times the audience after they tried to
01:20:44.480 cancel chimal yeah the White House
01:20:46.400 released the statement it doesn't it
01:20:48.239 doesn't it doesn't really work when you
01:20:49.840 have like core fans that believe in you
01:20:51.679 and I feel like you guys have probably
01:20:53.000 built that you know the relationship
01:20:54.800 you've built with your fans there's
01:20:55.760 probably people very grateful of the
01:20:58.159 information that you give them and uh so
01:21:00.719 when they try to paint you in a certain
01:21:02.239 light you actually have like a hundred
01:21:04.199 hours of time with those people that
01:21:07.000 they know you to be more than that one
01:21:08.880 statement that you've said so now
01:21:10.639 they're not as concerned about that
01:21:12.199 thing you said that maybe is taken out
01:21:13.679 of context or people have been offended
01:21:15.440 by I think like the biggest thing that
01:21:17.040 people miss about comedians is like
01:21:19.960 you're allowed to be offended by the
01:21:21.840 joke that I say like you're allowed to
01:21:23.639 react however the [ __ ] want to react
01:21:25.199 about it you had your life you went
01:21:26.719 through some crazy [ __ ] maybe you're
01:21:29.400 maybe you were bullied as [ __ ] as a kid
01:21:30.960 and like you don't want other people to
01:21:32.400 potentially have those feelings so you
01:21:33.679 see a joke that could elicit that and
01:21:35.320 you're like I want to protect that from
01:21:36.880 that protect them from that that's kind
01:21:38.239 of noble I'm like I'm cool with that if
01:21:41.040 you yourself tell me you don't like me
01:21:43.159 teasing you I'm not going to tease you
01:21:44.639 personally ever again I want you to feel
01:21:46.360 good but it doesn't mean that I won't
01:21:48.320 continue to make those jokes somewhere
01:21:49.760 else and I think my shows like I got the
01:21:52.080 most diverse audience in comedy history
01:21:54.280 yeah so it's like you come out to one of
01:21:56.800 my shows you can't tell me that people
01:21:59.000 don't like these jokes and I tried very
01:22:02.000 hard to like like if I'm curious about
01:22:04.480 your culture you'll know it through the
01:22:06.000 jokes it's not some little [ __ ] like
01:22:08.600 I'll try to dive deep and even surprise
01:22:10.920 you about something that I might know
01:22:12.800 and I think in that way people start to
01:22:14.679 feel seen and they don't feel bullied
01:22:16.880 they actually feel like represented and
01:22:18.880 they're like excited about it look you
01:22:20.800 you said something at the beginning
01:22:22.080 which I thought was really interesting
01:22:23.360 which is you're like a you have to Great
01:22:25.239 comedians are great observers of culture
01:22:28.080 so can you can you just tell us like
01:22:29.600 just observe the cultural moment what we
01:22:31.920 talked a lot about it but I just want
01:22:33.120 you to be maybe like put a point on it
01:22:35.000 where are we where's America what the
01:22:37.120 hell is going on like What's happen
01:22:38.920 what's happening however you feel that
01:22:40.800 question like what the hell is going on
01:22:43.520 um all-time low confidence in uh
01:22:48.760 institutions low confidence in
01:22:52.679 information there's an obs with
01:22:54.880 conspiracy because there's I mean that's
01:22:57.280 twofold one like it's the easiest way
01:22:59.320 for dumb people to feel smart like when
01:23:00.960 you know something no one else knows and
01:23:02.320 you get to share with people like
01:23:03.480 there's that like dopamine hit where
01:23:04.920 like I bet you didn't know this happened
01:23:06.239 you know yeah um but those thrive in
01:23:08.800 times where there's not real
01:23:10.639 transparency so I think everybody's
01:23:13.480 looking for answers and nothing is
01:23:15.159 exactly how it seems and the only way to
01:23:17.360 reins still that confidence is I think
01:23:18.960 like brutal transparency like you got to
01:23:21.520 just be like really honest with the
01:23:23.239 people this is what it is and we're
01:23:24.960 Americans we're proud people you know so
01:23:26.880 we can get through whatever you say but
01:23:29.159 you got to tell it to us as it is and I
01:23:31.960 think we're just assessing relationships
01:23:33.600 right now and I think like when the
01:23:35.000 economy is rough like you're seeing all
01:23:37.239 the Jewish stuff right now right like
01:23:39.360 obviously with the conf crazy well this
01:23:41.880 is the thing you got to understand like
01:23:43.440 most people have never met a Jewish
01:23:44.800 person like most Americans have no clue
01:23:47.199 what a Jewish person is outside of Kiran
01:23:48.719 enthusiasm or Seinfeld they don't know
01:23:50.639 what it is they think Jews are Upper
01:23:53.280 East Side New Yorkers like yeah the like
01:23:56.960 Seinfeld or they think it's like hedum
01:23:59.239 like it's just like one or the other
01:24:00.400 exactly they don't even know what like a
01:24:01.719 spartic Jew they don't know what an
01:24:03.159 African Jew is or a Moroccan Jew they
01:24:04.920 have no clue what that is and they
01:24:07.600 shouldn't they're like how many Jews are
01:24:09.480 there they're like more people from La
01:24:11.000 than there are Jews right like it's like
01:24:12.360 a very small population so I think
01:24:15.280 there's like a little bit of a
01:24:16.840 disconnect and you know when you don't
01:24:20.360 know a people and I think this is
01:24:22.199 probably true I could be off but I think
01:24:24.520 like an ambient feeling towards Jews
01:24:27.239 from people who don't know Jews it's an
01:24:29.360 ambient light and the stereotypes are
01:24:33.480 probably not like the best they're not
01:24:35.840 exactly negative as long as the economy
01:24:37.920 is good right they're like oh they
01:24:40.360 they're successful they kind of stick
01:24:42.040 together they they own businesses they
01:24:44.159 whatever and as long as the econom is
01:24:45.639 good everybody's cool and then eggs get
01:24:48.119 expensive and you're Buy on your rent
01:24:50.119 and you don't feel hope and you don't
01:24:51.960 and then you start going why do they got
01:24:53.920 all that what the what are they about
01:24:56.760 why are they why are they separatists
01:24:58.679 you know like I'm here prizz and I'm
01:25:00.760 trying to get everybody to go to heaven
01:25:02.040 and they just got their own thing what
01:25:04.080 and it's very easy for them to become
01:25:06.119 this like other group and then you
01:25:08.119 extrapolate that with what's happening
01:25:09.960 like Palestine and and Israel and you
01:25:13.440 get people to start like assessing like
01:25:15.280 the relationship between America and
01:25:17.159 another country like you saw America
01:25:19.600 become very uninterested in Ukraine
01:25:23.239 quickly like we we we the second the
01:25:26.199 economy goes down we start going well
01:25:28.080 what do they do for us what why are we
01:25:30.080 giving them like and they're starting to
01:25:33.080 ask similar questions about Israel and
01:25:37.239 there's a lot of anti-semites that are
01:25:38.639 jumping on on it and they're muddying
01:25:39.960 the whole thing they're going ah this is
01:25:41.679 what did they control the government
01:25:42.960 they do this all the every conspiracy is
01:25:46.080 time by the way you're you're speaking a
01:25:48.679 profound secret that many
01:25:52.040 administrations in government have known
01:25:54.000 for long time and I think this is where
01:25:55.560 some of the mistrust comes from I talked
01:25:58.080 about this like maybe it was like a
01:25:59.199 couple months ago but the most
01:26:01.440 incredible stock market was actually
01:26:03.119 under Biden the most amount of money
01:26:05.600 printed was under Biden the most
01:26:08.000 cumulative total budget deficits was
01:26:10.400 under Biden the most amount of
01:26:12.639 short-term refinancing of debt was under
01:26:15.760 Biden and part of what you can explain
01:26:17.920 is that if you keep the signals that
01:26:20.840 everything is healthy or up you're
01:26:23.560 allowed to prop all of these other
01:26:25.440 things that would get very quickly
01:26:29.199 recapitulated and when you take the gas
01:26:31.360 out of the market and you take the gas
01:26:32.880 out of all these other markets and all
01:26:34.440 of a sudden the price of energy is up
01:26:36.080 and the price of this is up and the
01:26:37.280 price of that is up then you start to
01:26:38.840 question hold on a second why are all of
01:26:40.440 these things as important you know the
01:26:43.440 above the line below the line
01:26:44.760 conversation that we have tried to have
01:26:46.440 several times on this pot Jason yeah and
01:26:48.880 you have to like meet people you have to
01:26:51.239 meet people where they feel in order to
01:26:53.040 communicate with them right right like
01:26:54.840 they could like when people right now
01:26:56.480 are like assessing like America's
01:26:57.960 relationship with Israel like it's it's
01:27:00.000 and and they you hear these like sound
01:27:01.600 bites like that's our closest Ally and
01:27:03.119 then they go what does that mean it's
01:27:04.400 like well let's explain to them what
01:27:06.040 that means like let's explain the
01:27:07.320 importance of that relationship and how
01:27:08.760 it's beneficial to Americans because if
01:27:10.800 you don't explain it and you just go oh
01:27:13.320 just be quiet whatever then they start
01:27:15.080 to look at these lunatics on Twitter and
01:27:17.960 start to go wait a minut is that is that
01:27:19.760 true yeah and then they're down the
01:27:21.000 conspiracy Hall like you have to explain
01:27:24.600 like I don't know what the mineral deal
01:27:26.239 was about but I know for with with
01:27:28.199 Ukraine but I know for a second there
01:27:30.080 are some Americans who go oh we're going
01:27:31.320 to get some minerals out of that all
01:27:32.520 right minerals sound good like they're
01:27:34.440 gonna pay us back it's that it's that
01:27:36.360 simplistic right so it's like I think I
01:27:38.719 think that kind of communication is
01:27:40.400 important and it will actually help
01:27:43.639 understand these relationships which I
01:27:45.520 imagine are very important I'm not privy
01:27:48.040 to all the geopolitical decisions that
01:27:49.960 are going on there who knows
01:27:51.360 intelligence from Israel could have
01:27:52.600 thwarted 20 more 911s yeah maybe you
01:27:54.880 can't say that because you expose the
01:27:56.600 intelligence operatives you have in the
01:27:58.040 field but it it would I think be helpful
01:28:00.639 to understand the value of that for the
01:28:03.040 everyday American so that when you see
01:28:05.040 something crazy on Twitter you can go
01:28:07.360 okay you're just a anti-semite and
01:28:09.119 you're looking for a justification for
01:28:10.719 your hate I mean this is your point
01:28:12.719 about Trump sometimes he has these take
01:28:15.360 we'll see you later bro take care David
01:28:17.000 this is like I think the point there's
01:28:19.000 going to be conspiracy theory about that
01:28:20.719 right now I just want to let you know
01:28:22.840 talked about Israel and he's like the
01:28:24.400 one Jewish guy left way to go way to go
01:28:26.679 Shela this is how it starts David David
01:28:30.159 this is how it starts you drove thanks a
01:28:32.639 lot you drove them out right chy when
01:28:34.320 you said um you know Trump's a masterful
01:28:36.320 kind of Communicator here Biden gave all
01:28:39.719 these weapons to to Ukraine under the
01:28:42.960 aices of what's called a lone lease they
01:28:45.159 have to pay them back but Biden never
01:28:47.119 communicated that well tell us and then
01:28:49.840 Trump comes out he's like you know what
01:28:51.520 we gave them 180 million 180 billion
01:28:54.159 they're going to give us 500 billion
01:28:55.400 back we're making a 40 he he basically
01:28:57.199 described a 42% compounded return sounds
01:29:00.440 good to me yeah better than anything
01:29:02.880 that's ever happened I mean he he's out
01:29:05.239 there in terms of his ability to
01:29:06.760 communicate at chath as we wrap here any
01:29:08.400 final thoughts what do you think about
01:29:11.719 Trump and what he's how he's doing and
01:29:14.239 what he's doing so far and what do you
01:29:15.440 think about Elon and Doge oh here we go
01:29:19.360 okay so uh Trump and what he's doing how
01:29:22.280 he's doing so far like I I I don't know
01:29:24.880 like in other words like I don't I don't
01:29:26.920 know if I can like assess it right away
01:29:28.719 maybe I'm giving him a little bit longer
01:29:31.320 uh like landing strip or whatever than
01:29:33.280 other people because I have a little bit
01:29:34.520 more hope or optimism I get if you don't
01:29:36.480 like the guy you're going see how
01:29:37.960 horrible this is immediately but I'm
01:29:39.840 going to give him a little bit more
01:29:40.840 leeway to see if it doesn't work out and
01:29:43.239 it's really horrible I'll be the first
01:29:44.880 person to call it out like I I've he's
01:29:47.199 in power we should definitely check the
01:29:48.960 people in power but I'm hoping that
01:29:51.239 these actions in the short term are
01:29:53.600 beneficial in the long term is everyone
01:29:55.440 going to work out no um do is like I'm
01:29:59.199 so depressed about not depressed stupid
01:30:01.080 but like I'm bummed about because I
01:30:02.520 don't think there's any American that is
01:30:04.560 pro waste inefficiency and bloat this
01:30:08.719 should be a bipartisan issue like all
01:30:11.000 Americans should be coming together
01:30:12.679 going oh my God the DMV is gonna get
01:30:14.960 better this sounds awesome and I think
01:30:19.080 you know I have a lot of respect for
01:30:20.400 Elon but I think sometimes on Twitter
01:30:22.840 he's like twisting knife a little bit
01:30:25.639 and it's like you don't need to twist
01:30:27.119 the knife like we all want this this is
01:30:29.760 something we can come together with as a
01:30:32.600 country in support this sounds great
01:30:36.040 don't twist it just kind of let it be
01:30:38.960 show your wins when you do something
01:30:41.280 wrong we can acknowledge the things that
01:30:43.040 we did are wrong and we'll respect that
01:30:44.760 it bums me that this has become so
01:30:46.159 partisan and I do understand there are a
01:30:48.600 lot of people on the left that are
01:30:49.840 making this partisan as well they're
01:30:52.119 weaponizing there was there was crazy
01:30:54.400 clip between Rogan and Elon where Rogan
01:30:57.040 was like how does all this go down
01:30:59.239 actually and he's like well I can't
01:31:00.920 really speak about the corruption
01:31:02.320 because I'm afraid it would get me
01:31:03.440 assassinated he's like actually if I
01:31:04.960 tell you what I know it was the weirdest
01:31:07.480 like two-minute clip and then they just
01:31:10.000 kind of left it and moved on and my
01:31:11.719 brain was like what are they talking
01:31:13.040 about what what must be going on there I
01:31:16.280 mean there's a lot of money going out
01:31:17.960 the door yeah but who's killing Eli like
01:31:20.199 if we are going to have World War III
01:31:21.920 don't you want the guy that has the
01:31:23.440 Rockets to go to Mars on your side yeah
01:31:26.159 yeah you kind of want the Super Genius
01:31:28.119 on your side for sure another thing
01:31:29.760 that's like really interesting to me is
01:31:31.199 like people keep going people keep doing
01:31:33.840 these things like what is elon's play
01:31:36.199 like what is he doing here like is he
01:31:37.840 actually G to take over and it's like
01:31:39.639 Elon has been dealing with like local
01:31:41.360 government for so long trying to push
01:31:43.760 through like he is not an American
01:31:46.040 citizen he cannot be president he is at
01:31:48.159 the highest position he will ever be in
01:31:50.000 his lifetime in America you can't get
01:31:52.239 higher than being the right-hand of the
01:31:54.320 president since you're not from America
01:31:56.119 you can be president so I think he's
01:31:58.320 going to behave really well because now
01:32:01.560 he's in the most powerful position he
01:32:03.480 will ever be in if you want to talk
01:32:05.440 about like power plays you gotta watch
01:32:08.639 out for JD that guy's a that guy's High
01:32:11.920 emotional intelligence like that that's
01:32:14.679 somebody that I would be keeping my eyes
01:32:16.600 on if I'm Trump but Elon he's GNA be a
01:32:19.000 good he's gonna be your best friend
01:32:21.080 because it's only downhill if he pisses
01:32:23.080 Trump off
01:32:25.239 interesting interesting little
01:32:26.480 Manchurian Candidate for JD I no no no
01:32:29.199 I'm not saying that he's gonna do
01:32:30.400 anything bad but he is like right don't
01:32:33.280 TR don't treat him light like we got
01:32:35.159 this don't sleep on JD New Yorkers we do
01:32:37.320 this all the time we hear someone with
01:32:38.400 like a Southern accent we think they're
01:32:39.600 a goofball and it's like right that guy
01:32:41.679 went from like a broken home to Yale
01:32:44.000 Appalachia to Yale and then the VP and
01:32:46.520 he's 40 he's your age he's like 40 he
01:32:49.000 called Trump Hitler or something and he
01:32:51.280 ended up as his he said I'm a never
01:32:52.639 Trump guy he he's so to say that he's
01:32:55.520 not emotionally intelligent does to say
01:32:58.000 he doesn't know how to manage up or
01:32:59.520 whatever that term is he's sappy I hey
01:33:02.440 keep an eye on him keep an eye on him
01:33:04.280 for sure all right listen Andrew Schultz
01:33:06.440 is playing at the Funny Bone on April
01:33:08.080 16th and 17th he'll be that Chuckles on
01:33:11.280 the 20th drink minimum two drink minimum
01:33:14.560 uh by the V you know where to find them
01:33:17.000 incredible
01:33:18.440 incredible Netflix special who do you
01:33:20.719 think who do you B last question who do
01:33:22.199 you think is the funniest if you had to
01:33:24.679 take a wild stab at who the funniest
01:33:26.480 person no me me Jason or free oh oh of
01:33:30.880 us between the three of you um okay so
01:33:34.320 you can say me Jason so Jason is the
01:33:36.679 most like naturally inclined to be funny
01:33:39.280 he's probably just the most funny being
01:33:40.719 around uh choth will probably get the
01:33:43.119 biggest laughs when he says something
01:33:44.920 funny because he's like he's not asking
01:33:47.280 for much like he'll just say something
01:33:49.719 that's like a dart and it will kind of
01:33:51.080 like hit you and you'll be like oh and
01:33:53.440 then I think David will like structure
01:33:56.199 something really funny and you'll be
01:33:57.679 like oh that was a clever I see how you
01:34:00.080 did that right there I um I was actually
01:34:02.239 when I was an astrophysicist shelsea I
01:34:04.679 am funny myself I did Summer Stock that
01:34:08.080 would be my take like I think if we're
01:34:09.239 off the Pod I think chamat says some
01:34:10.960 like wild sh that everybody goes what
01:34:13.239 the I think you say that the most that's
01:34:15.600 what I would say there you go all right
01:34:17.520 Andy Schultz picks me they have it Mom I
01:34:20.520 would like to clip that and uh yeah all
01:34:23.520 right continued success come back
01:34:25.199 anytime I like the way Schultz
01:34:26.239 pronounces but I may go to chamath I
01:34:28.000 like that Cham ch ch yeah chamath is too
01:34:30.880 it's too used actually we should go to a
01:34:32.400 different pronunciation I love chamoth
01:34:34.679 chth is just so it's tough with the it's
01:34:37.840 tough with the I know you forong but
01:34:39.119 it's tough with the names from over
01:34:40.280 there like my podcast co-host Akash
01:34:42.320 right Akash everybody calls him Akash
01:34:45.199 now I his name is spelled with two A's
01:34:47.880 A's a after so it's like a you if it's
01:34:51.320 got two A's next to each other after you
01:34:54.239 go there but it's
01:34:56.560 aash it is tricky but he said like his
01:34:59.080 parents specifically picked a name he
01:35:01.199 thought that Americans would be able to
01:35:03.239 pronounce they calculated that and like
01:35:06.280 they wereing him I think that's like a I
01:35:08.520 think that's a really beautiful thing
01:35:09.760 for a kid like you you go you know like
01:35:12.040 how much could called they could have
01:35:13.679 named him John Steve if they wanted it
01:35:16.280 pron had to keep it real though they
01:35:17.800 still had keep it real they would keep
01:35:19.840 eight when I could when I could read and
01:35:21.960 write English well eight okay cuz it was
01:35:23.760 my second language and when I saw my
01:35:25.280 name written out I was like what the fu
01:35:27.600 did they do to me here what is this my
01:35:30.000 middle name m name is like 15 other
01:35:33.280 letters name a name that has math in it
01:35:37.199 like they knew what they wanted you know
01:35:39.440 yes they were like if you can if you can
01:35:41.920 pronounce this you can solve the Pagan
01:35:44.000 theor true this is this is harder than
01:35:46.679 thean be an engineer oh I'm so proud of
01:35:51.199 him he's going to figure it out get us
01:35:53.880 two month he's going to get us ask a
01:35:56.400 question Andrew is it racist if I do an
01:35:58.119 Indian impersonation because I know I
01:35:59.719 can do Italian and Irish but can I do no
01:36:02.119 it's funny bro I don't think so but I
01:36:04.159 think it's like is it the intent I'm
01:36:05.960 just I don't even think it's the intent
01:36:07.600 I think if you like if you say certain
01:36:09.800 things like if you say
01:36:12.119 B right like if if you say that like
01:36:16.360 that's like my love like you know if you
01:36:18.840 say little things that are more than
01:36:20.920 just the sound but if you tap into the C
01:36:23.760 like to let them know hey I didn't learn
01:36:25.840 this from The Simpsons like I learned it
01:36:27.679 from my buddy's family then I think
01:36:30.360 you'll see people who are like Indian
01:36:32.320 Sri Lanka they'll be like oh he oh he
01:36:34.480 got he's got friends he got he knows he
